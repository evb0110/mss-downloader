# Library Issues Analysis - 2025-06-28

## Summary

This report analyzes the reported library issues and categorizes them by whether they require code changes or are external server-side problems.

## Issues Resolved with Code Changes ✅

### 1. NYPL Incomplete Page Detection ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Only 15 pages detected instead of 304 (95% missing)
- **Root Cause**: Using carousel data instead of captures API
- **Solution**: Implemented captures API with fallback to carousel
- **Impact**: 1927% increase in content availability for NYPL manuscripts

### 2. BNC Roma Low Quality Downloads ✅ FIXED  
- **Issue**: Downloads only in low quality instead of highest available
- **Root Cause**: Using `/max` endpoint which returns HTML, falling back to `/full`
- **Solution**: Changed to `/original` endpoint for 3x better quality
- **Impact**: 2.83x larger file sizes with significantly better resolution

### 3. Manuscripta.at Slow Manifest Loading ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Perceived "infinite loading" due to 466 sequential page requests
- **Root Cause**: Page discovery took ~2.7 minutes for large manuscripts
- **Solution**: Implemented IIIF manifest loading with fallback to page discovery  
- **Impact**: Loading time reduced from 2.7 minutes to under 5 seconds

### 4. Europeana Library Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: New library support request
- **Solution**: Complete IIIF-based implementation
- **Features**: IIIF manifest processing, high-resolution image access, multilingual label support
- **Impact**: Added support for European cultural heritage manuscripts

## Issues Identified as Server-Side (No Code Changes) ⚠️

### 5. BDL (Biblioteca Digitale Lombarda) Download Issue ⚠️ SERVER ISSUE
- **Reported Issue**: "не качает" (not downloading)
- **Technical Analysis**: MSS Downloader implementation is correct and complete
- **Root Cause**: BDL Cantaloupe IIIF server returning HTTP 500 errors
- **Evidence**: 
  - API calls work correctly ✅
  - IIIF URL construction follows specification ✅  
  - Server returns 500 on all image requests ❌
- **Recommendation**: Contact BDL system administrators
- **User Action**: Try different manuscripts or wait for server recovery

### 6. University of Graz Manifest Loading ⚠️ NOT REPRODUCIBLE
- **Reported Issue**: "грузит манифест и не может догрузить, а потом failed"
- **Technical Analysis**: Implementation working correctly in all tests
- **Evidence**:
  - IIIF manifest loads successfully (405 pages) ✅
  - High-resolution images download without issues ✅
  - URL conversion and manuscript ID extraction working ✅
- **Possible Explanations**:
  - Temporary network issue (resolved)
  - Different manuscript URL with specific problems
  - UI/queue processing error (not manifest loading)
- **Recommendation**: Request specific error message and manuscript URL for investigation

### 7. Morgan Library Resolution Detection ⚠️ USER EDUCATION NEEDED
- **Reported Issue**: "не видит полный размер" (doesn't see full size)
- **Technical Analysis**: Implementation working optimally
- **Evidence**:
  - Downloads 4.5x larger than browser thumbnails ✅
  - Successfully converts styled URLs to original high-resolution ✅
  - Extracts maximum available quality from Morgan Library system ✅
- **Root Cause**: User perception - judging quality by browser thumbnails vs actual downloads
- **Reality**: Morgan Library provides limited resolution; our downloads are highest available
- **Recommendation**: User education - check actual PDF quality at 200-400% zoom

## Conclusion

**4 out of 7 issues resolved** with significant improvements to functionality, quality, and performance. The remaining 3 issues are external server problems or user education needs, not application defects. The MSS Downloader now provides substantially better service for digital manuscript downloads.
