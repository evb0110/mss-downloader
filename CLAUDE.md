## üö® ABSOLUTE MANDATORY RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS üö®

### -3. COMMAND PRIORITY HIERARCHY - USER COMMANDS OVERRIDE ALL DEFAULTS üëë

**üö® CATASTROPHIC LESSON LEARNED: User commands ALWAYS override default restrictions üö®**

#### üì¢ ABSOLUTE COMMAND PRIORITY ORDER
```
1. EXPLICIT USER COMMANDS (highest priority)
2. SAFETY GATE FAILURES (precommit/build errors) 
3. DEFAULT AUTOMATION RULES
4. OPTIMIZATION PREFERENCES (lowest priority)
```

#### üî• CRITICAL COMMAND OVERRIDES
**"bump all" Command:**
- OVERRIDES: "FORBIDDEN: git add ." restriction
- REQUIRES: `git add -A` to stage ALL files including untracked
- MANDATORY: Include untracked files even if normally prohibited
- **Pattern Recognition**: User frustration = missed command priority

**"bump once more" / "don't you understand" Signals:**
- USER IS TELLING YOU TO VERSION BUMP
- Context: Previous build failed = need new version bump
- NEVER ask "should I bump?" - just do it immediately
- Pattern: Build failure + user prompt = emergency bump protocol

**Emergency User Direction:**
- User says "this is critical!!!!" = IMMEDIATE STOP current approach
- User corrects approach = abandon current method immediately  
- User frustration signals = you missed something obvious

#### ‚öñÔ∏è COMMAND OVERRIDE EXAMPLES
**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```
User: "bump all"
Claude: git add -A  # Overrides normal git add restrictions
       npm run precommit
       # Include ALL files per explicit user command
```

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```
User: "bump all" 
Claude: git add package.json  # Ignores "all" directive
        # Missing untracked files causes build failures
```

### -2.5. PRECOMMIT ZERO TOLERANCE - ABSOLUTELY BULLETPROOF üõ°Ô∏è‚ö°

**üö® CATASTROPHIC LESSON LEARNED: NEVER bypass precommit failures üö®**

#### üõë PRECOMMIT FAILURE = IMMEDIATE FULL STOP
```
üö® IF npm run precommit FAILS:
   ‚ùå STOP all version bump activity IMMEDIATELY
   ‚ùå NO "build passes anyway" logic EVER
   ‚ùå NO "types don't matter" reasoning EVER
   ‚úÖ FIX type errors FIRST before ANY commit
   ‚úÖ Use npm run typefix + npm run typecheck
   ‚úÖ Only proceed after precommit passes 100%
```

#### üß† ANTI-BYPASS PSYCHOLOGY
**Forbidden Thoughts (that led to disasters):**
- "Build passes so types don't matter" ‚Üê CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG
- "Type errors are just warnings" ‚Üê CAUSES PRODUCTION CRASHES  
- "We can fix types later" ‚Üê NEVER ACCEPTABLE
- "User is waiting, skip type safety" ‚Üê DISASTER THINKING

**Required Mindset:**
- Types = production crash prevention
- Precommit failure = code is broken
- No urgency justifies bypassing type safety
- User would rather wait than get broken code

#### üî• PRECOMMIT FAILURE EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP**: All version bump activity
2. **IDENTIFY ERRORS**: Read npm run precommit output completely  
3. **AUTO-FIX ATTEMPT**: `npm run typefix`
4. **VERIFY FIX**: `npm run typecheck`
5. **ONLY IF CLEAN**: Proceed with version bump
6. **IF STILL FAILING**: Manual type fixes required before ANY progress

### -2.2. VERSION BUMP DECISION TREE - BULLETPROOF COMMAND RECOGNITION üå≥

**üö® CATASTROPHIC LESSON LEARNED: User bump commands are not requests - they're orders üö®**

#### üìä VERSION BUMP COMMAND MATRIX

**"bump" (standard):**
- Files: `git add -u` (tracked modified files only)
- Use: Normal incremental changes
- Safety: Standard precommit + build

**"bump all" (comprehensive):**
- Files: `git add -A` (ALL files including untracked)
- OVERRIDES: Normal git add restrictions
- Use: Major changes, new files, dependencies
- Safety: Precommit + build with ALL files staged

**"bump once more" / "you need to bump again" (emergency):**
- Context: Previous build failed, user directing fix
- Files: `git add -A` (assume comprehensive fix needed)
- Use: Cascading build failures, missing files
- Safety: Emergency protocols, rapid deployment

**"beware previous build failed" + bump context:**
- Translation: "Fix the build failure with new version"
- Action: Immediate version bump with comprehensive file staging
- NOT: "Just be careful" - it's direction to bump

#### üö® USER FRUSTRATION SIGNAL RECOGNITION
**"don't you understand you need to bump once more??"**
- Translation: "I've told you to version bump multiple times"
- Missed Context: Previous build failures require new versions
- Action Required: Immediate version bump, comprehensive staging
- Pattern: User frustration = you missed obvious direction

### -2.1. BUILD FAILURE EMERGENCY PROTOCOL - SYSTEMATIC DISASTER RESPONSE üöë

**üö® CATASTROPHIC LESSON LEARNED: Fix root cause, not symptoms üö®**

#### üî• CASCADING BUILD FAILURE RESPONSE

**Phase 1: IMMEDIATE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT**
```bash
# 1. Identify failure scope
gh run list --limit 5  # Recent build status
git status --porcelain  # What files are staged/modified

# 2. Check for missing files (most common cause)
grep -n "Could not resolve" <build-log>
grep -n "Module not found" <build-log>
```

**Phase 2: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION**
- **Missing Files**: Most common cause of build failures
- **Untracked Dependencies**: New files not committed
- **Type Errors**: Precommit bypassed (should be impossible)
- **Import Paths**: Refactoring without updating references

**Phase 3: RAPID FIX PROTOCOL**
```bash
# For missing files (most common)
git add <missing-file>
git commit -m "fix(build): add missing <filename>"
git push  # IMMEDIATE push to fix main branch

# Version bump AFTER fixing root cause
npm version patch
git push --tags
```

**Phase 4: CASCADE PREVENTION**
- **ONE FIX AT A TIME**: Don't batch multiple changes
- **IMMEDIATE PUSH**: Fix main branch before adding more commits  
- **ROOT CAUSE FOCUS**: Find why files were missed initially
- **PROCESS UPDATE**: Prevent same failure pattern

#### üõ°Ô∏è ANTI-CASCADE PATTERNS
**‚úÖ CORRECT (Root Cause First):**
1. Identify missing GlobalDziCache.ts
2. `git add src/main/services/GlobalDziCache.ts`
3. `git commit -m "fix(build): add missing GlobalDziCache.ts"`
4. `git push` ‚Üê Fix main branch first
5. THEN version bump if needed

**‚ùå WRONG (Symptom Fighting):**
1. Try to trigger rebuild without fixing missing files
2. Create multiple failing commits
3. Version bump while root cause still exists
4. Stack failures on top of failures

### -2. CODE PRESERVATION HIERARCHY - PROTECT WORKING CODE üèóÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

**üö® CATASTROPHIC LESSON LEARNED: Preserve working runtime code, adapt types üö®**

#### üéØ CHANGE RISK ASSESSMENT HIERARCHY
```
1. TYPE ADJUSTMENTS (lowest risk)
   - Make types more flexible/permissive
   - Add type assertions or any casts
   - Update interface definitions

2. IMPORT/EXPORT CHANGES (low risk)
   - Add missing exports
   - Update import paths  
   - Adjust module references

3. RUNTIME LOGIC CHANGES (high risk)
   - Modify function behavior
   - Change control flow
   - Alter data processing

4. CORE ALGORITHM CHANGES (highest risk)
   - Change download logic
   - Modify manifest processing
   - Alter queue management
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è TYPE VS RUNTIME DECISION MATRIX
**Scenario: "eta: -1" causing type errors**

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH (Type Adjustment):**
- Problem: Type expects number, runtime returns -1
- Solution: Allow -1 in type definition or use type assertion
- Risk: Very low - types match existing working behavior
- Code: `eta?: number | -1` or `eta: any`

**‚ùå WRONG APPROACH (Runtime Change):**
- Problem: Same type error
- Solution: Change runtime logic to avoid -1
- Risk: High - could break working download timing
- Code: Modify tested algorithm behavior

#### üèõÔ∏è CODE PRESERVATION PRINCIPLES
1. **Working Code is Sacred**: If it works in production, don't change runtime behavior
2. **Types Serve Code**: Make types match reality, not force code to match types  
3. **Risk Assessment**: Always choose lower-risk solution
4. **User Direction Priority**: When user says "don't change runtime code" - obey immediately

### -1. LIBRARY ROUTING ARCHITECTURE - CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING üèóÔ∏è

**THE #1 CAUSE OF CRITICAL FAILURES:** "Two Implementations Bug" - 60% of critical failures are routing issues

#### üö® ROUTING COLLISION PATTERNS (MUST UNDERSTAND)

**Pattern 1: Two Implementations Exist**
Many libraries have BOTH a dedicated loader AND a SharedManifestLoaders method:
- `LibraryLoader.ts` in `/src/main/services/library-loaders/`  
- `getLibraryManifest()` in `/src/shared/SharedManifestLoaders.ts`

**Pattern 2: Registration vs Routing Mismatch**  
Library registered with key `'libraryname'` but routed to `'library_name'` (or vice versa)

**Pattern 3: URL Detection vs Routing Mismatch**
URL detection returns `'detected_name'` but routing expects `'registered_name'`

#### üîç ROUTING FLOW ARCHITECTURE

```
1. URL INPUT ‚Üí SharedLibraryDetector.detectLibrary()
2. DETECTION ‚Üí Returns library identifier (e.g., 'saint_omer')  
3. ROUTING ‚Üí EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.loadManifest()
4. SWITCH CASE ‚Üí Routes to loader based on identifier
5. LOADER CALL ‚Üí Either loadLibraryManifest() OR sharedManifestAdapter.getManifestForLibrary()
```

#### üìç CRITICAL FILES FOR ROUTING

**Detection**: `/src/shared/SharedLibraryDetector.ts`
- URL patterns ‚Üí Library identifiers
- MUST match routing expectations exactly

**Routing**: `/src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts` (lines ~2000-2200)  
- Switch case statement routes identifiers to implementations
- MUST use correct loader registration keys

**Individual Loaders**: `/src/main/services/library-loaders/`
- Registered in LoaderRegistry with specific keys
- MUST match routing case statements

**Shared Methods**: `/src/shared/SharedManifestLoaders.ts`
- Alternative implementation for many libraries  
- Often bypassed by routing to individual loaders

#### ‚ö° COMMON ROUTING FAILURES (LEARNED FROM ULTRATHINK)

1. **Saint-Omer**: Detected as `'saint_omer'`, routed to `'saint_omer'`, but registered as `'saintomer'` ‚Üí FAILURE
2. **HHU**: Detected as `'hhu'`, routed to SharedManifest, but should use `HhuLoader` ‚Üí FAILURE  
3. **ICCU/Monte-Cassino**: Detected as `'iccu'`, routed to `'monte_cassino'`, but registered as `'montecassino'` ‚Üí FAILURE
4. **Toronto**: Detected as `'toronto'`, routed to SharedManifest, but should use `TorontoLoader` ‚Üí FAILURE

#### üõ†Ô∏è ROUTING FIX METHODOLOGY

**Step 1: Identify the routing path**
```bash
# Find detection logic
grep -n "library_name" src/shared/SharedLibraryDetector.ts

# Find routing logic  
grep -n "case 'library_name'" src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts

# Find loader registration
grep -rn "library_name" src/main/services/library-loaders/
```

**Step 2: Check for implementation mismatch**
- Does a `LibraryLoader.ts` exist?
- Does a `getLibraryManifest()` method exist in SharedManifestLoaders?
- Which one should be used? (Usually individual loader is more comprehensive)

**Step 3: Align the identifiers**
- Detection output MUST match routing case
- Routing case MUST match loader registration key
- All three MUST use identical string identifiers

#### üèõÔ∏è ROME LIBRARY SPECIFIC WARNING  
- **TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS EXIST:** RomeLoader.ts AND SharedManifestLoaders.getRomeManifest()
- **ROUTING COLLISION RISK:** Rome manuscripts vs ICCU catalog references both use similar identifiers
- **CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** `digitale.bnc.roma.sbn.it` (genuine Rome) vs `manus.iccu.sbn.it` (catalog)
- **SharedManifestLoaders PATH:** src/shared/SharedManifestLoaders.ts (getRomeManifest, discoverRomePageCount)
- **RomeLoader PATH:** src/main/services/library-loaders/RomeLoader.ts

### -0.5. ROUTING DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY üîç

**BEFORE making ANY routing changes, ALWAYS:**

#### üß™ Diagnosis Phase
```bash
# 1. Identify current routing path
echo "Testing: https://example.com/manuscript" | node -e "
const detector = require('./src/shared/SharedLibraryDetector.ts');
const input = require('fs').readFileSync(0, 'utf8').trim();
console.log('Detected:', detector.detectLibrary(input));
"

# 2. Check if loader exists
ls src/main/services/library-loaders/*Loader.ts | grep -i library_name

# 3. Check SharedManifestLoaders method
grep -n "getLibraryManifest\|library_name" src/shared/SharedManifestLoaders.ts

# 4. Verify registration
grep -rn "library_name" src/main/services/library-loaders/ | grep "register\|export"
```

#### üéØ Testing Phase (MANDATORY before committing)
```bash
# Test individual components
bun test-routing-component.ts  # Create for specific library

# Test URL detection
bun test-url-detection.ts      # Verify detection returns expected ID

# Test loader registration  
bun test-loader-registry.ts    # Verify loader is properly registered

# Test full routing path
bun test-full-routing.ts       # End-to-end routing validation
```

#### üìù Documentation Phase
```typescript
// ALWAYS document routing decisions in code
case 'library_name':
    // ROUTING: library_name ‚Üí LibraryLoader (registered as 'library_name')
    // WHY: Individual loader has advanced features vs SharedManifest basic implementation
    // TESTED: 2024-XX-XX with manuscripts: MS123, MS456  
    manifest = await this.loadLibraryManifest('library_name', originalUrl);
    break;
```

#### üö® ROUTING VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Detection output matches routing case string exactly
- [ ] Routing case matches loader registration key exactly  
- [ ] Loader exists and is properly registered
- [ ] Test with real manuscript URLs (minimum 2 different manuscripts)
- [ ] Document routing decision with reasoning
- [ ] Verify no regressions in related libraries (especially Rome/ICCU/Monte-Cassino)

#### üõ°Ô∏è ROME/ICCU/MONTE-CASSINO COLLISION PREVENTION
**NEVER change routing for these libraries without testing ALL THREE:**
- Rome: `http://digitale.bnc.roma.sbn.it/tecadigitale/manoscrittoantico/BNCR_Ms_SESS_0062`
- ICCU: `https://manus.iccu.sbn.it/cnmd/0000313047`  
- Monte-Cassino: Direct OMNES IIIF manuscripts

**These three libraries have complex interdependencies that can create cascading failures.**

#### üéì ULTRATHINK LESSONS LEARNED (v1.4.230-231)

**Critical Discoveries from 10 Ultrathink Agents:**
1. **60% of failures** were "Two Implementations Bug" routing issues
2. **Routing identifier mismatches** are the #1 cause of "loader not available" errors  
3. **Rome/ICCU/Monte-Cassino** form a triad with dangerous routing collision potential
4. **Individual loaders** are usually more comprehensive than SharedManifestLoaders methods
5. **URL pattern support** varies widely between implementations (IIIF vs web parsing)

**Specific Pattern Failures:**
- `'saint_omer'` ‚Üí `'saintomer'` (underscore mismatch)
- `'toronto'` ‚Üí SharedManifest instead of TorontoLoader  
- `'hhu'` ‚Üí SharedManifest instead of HhuLoader
- `'monte_cassino'` ‚Üí `'montecassino'` (underscore collision with Rome)
- `'arca'` ‚Üí IIIF vs web parsing dual system routing

**Success Patterns:**
- **Individual Loader First**: Route to dedicated loaders when they exist
- **Identifier Consistency**: Keep detection ‚Üí routing ‚Üí registration identical
- **Fallback Strategies**: IIIF-first with web parsing fallback (IRHT model)
- **Clear Error Messages**: Distinguish between "not found" vs "routing failure"

#### üö® ROUTING EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROTOCOL

**If you break routing and need immediate fix:**

1. **IDENTIFY SCOPE**: Which libraries are affected?
2. **ROLLBACK STRATEGY**: Can you revert to last working state?
3. **ISOLATION**: Fix one library at a time, test independently  
4. **VALIDATION**: Test ALL interdependent libraries (Rome/ICCU/Monte-Cassino)
5. **DOCUMENTATION**: Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns discovered

**Emergency Test URLs (ALWAYS test these after routing changes):**
```bash
# Rome library (genuine Rome manuscripts)
http://digitale.bnc.roma.sbn.it/tecadigitale/manoscrittoantico/BNCR_Ms_SESS_0062/BNCR_Ms_SESS_0062/1

# ICCU catalog (routes to Monte Cassino)  
https://manus.iccu.sbn.it/cnmd/0000313047

# Monte Cassino direct IIIF
# (Test with actual OMNES URLs when server accessible)

# Saint-Omer (routing identifier test)
https://bibliotheque-numerique.bibliotheque-agglo-stomer.fr/viewer/22581/

# Toronto (individual loader test)  
https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/fisher2:F6521

# HHU (IIIF pattern support test)
https://digital.ulb.hhu.de/i3f/v20/7674176/manifest
```

### -2. LIBRARY REQUESTS = IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION - NO DEFERRALS EVER üöÄ
- **WHEN USER REQUESTS LIBRARY:** Implement NOW, not "in future versions"
- **FORBIDDEN RESPONSES:** "–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–æ –∫ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—é", "Will be added later", "Documented for consideration"
- **REQUIRED RESPONSE:** Create loader ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí "‚úÖ Implemented in v1.4.XXX"
- **TIME LIMIT:** 1-2 hours maximum from request to deployment
- **NO EXCUSES:** Complex library = still implement basic version NOW
- **USER EXPECTATION:** When they request, they expect immediate action, not promises

### 0. NO ARTIFICIAL LIMITS OR CAPS - EVER
- **NEVER SET PAGE CAPS:** Do NOT limit pages to 256, 512, 1024 or ANY number
- **NEVER HARDCODE LIMITS:** No manuscript is "too large" - users decide what to download
- **DYNAMIC DISCOVERY ONLY:** Always discover actual page count through proper detection
- **FIX ROOT CAUSES:** If getting wrong page counts, fix the detection logic, don't cap results
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS:** Don't assume "most manuscripts are < X pages" - detect actual count
- **USER CONTROLS LIMITS:** Only users can set page ranges, never impose artificial restrictions

### 0.5. CACHE PURGE ON DELETION - ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY
- **ALWAYS CLEAR CACHE:** When ANY manuscript is deleted, its cache MUST be cleared
- **100% COVERAGE REQUIRED:** clearCompleted, clearFailed, clearAll, removeManuscript - ALL must clear cache
- **NO EXCEPTIONS:** Every library, every deletion method, every scenario - cache MUST be purged
- **PREVENTS DATA CORRUPTION:** Old/wrong cached data causes "unfixable" manuscript issues
- **SILENT BUG KILLER:** Missing cache clear = users stuck with corrupted data forever
- **CRITICAL FOR USER EXPERIENCE:** Without cache purge, deleted manuscripts retain bad data

### 0.6. FILENAME DISCOVERY - NO PATTERN ASSUMPTIONS
- **NEVER ASSUME FILENAME PATTERNS:** NEVER guess "001r.jp2", "002v.jp2" or ANY filename patterns
- **DISCOVER FROM SOURCE:** Always get actual filenames from manifests, server responses, or directory listings
- **NO SEMANTIC ASSUMPTIONS:** Don't assume "recto/verso", "page1/page2", or any naming conventions
- **SERVER IS AUTHORITY:** Only the server knows what files actually exist - trust server responses only
- **MANIFEST-FIRST APPROACH:** Parse IIIF manifests, JSON responses, HTML listings, or API endpoints for real filenames
- **404 = WRONG APPROACH:** If getting 404s, you're assuming patterns instead of discovering actual files
- **EXAMPLES OF WRONG:** Generating "058r.jp2" because you expect recto/verso pairs
- **EXAMPLES OF RIGHT:** Parsing manifest JSON to get "ms_fragment_a_side1.tiff" as the actual filename

### 1. ELECTRON EXECUTION - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
- **NEVER RUN ELECTRON DIRECTLY:** Do NOT execute `electron`, `npm run dev`, `npm run dev:headless` or ANY Electron commands
- **USER RUNS THE APP:** The user will run the application themselves when needed
- **NO BACKGROUND PROCESSES:** Never start Electron processes in background or foreground
- **SINGLE INSTANCE LOCK:** Electron has single-instance lock - your processes block user's app!
- **BUILD ONLY:** You may run `npm run build` but NEVER launch the app

### 1.5. ROUTING ARCHITECTURE CHANGES - MANDATORY PROCESS üìã

**NEVER make routing changes without following this process:**

#### üìã PRE-CHANGE CHECKLIST
```bash
# 1. Document current state
git status && git diff > /tmp/pre-routing-state.diff

# 2. Create test URLs file  
echo "# Test URLs for library_name routing change" > .devkit/testing/routing-test-urls.txt
echo "https://example.com/manuscript1" >> .devkit/testing/routing-test-urls.txt
echo "https://example.com/manuscript2" >> .devkit/testing/routing-test-urls.txt

# 3. Test current behavior
for url in $(cat .devkit/testing/routing-test-urls.txt | grep -v '#'); do
    echo "Testing: $url"
    bun test-current-routing.ts "$url"
done

# 4. Backup current routing logic
cp src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts \
   .devkit/backup/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.pre-change.ts
```

#### ‚úÖ POST-CHANGE VALIDATION
```bash
# 1. Build test (MUST pass)
npm run build || exit 1

# 2. Test affected library URLs
for url in $(cat .devkit/testing/routing-test-urls.txt | grep -v '#'); do
    echo "POST-CHANGE Testing: $url"
    bun test-new-routing.ts "$url" || exit 1
done

# 3. Test Rome/ICCU/Monte-Cassino triad (MANDATORY)
bun test-rome-triad.ts || exit 1

# 4. Git commit with detailed message
git add -A
git commit -m "üîß ROUTING: library_name ‚Üí NewImplementation

CHANGE: Detection 'library_name' now routes to NewLoader instead of SharedManifest
WHY: NewLoader has advanced features vs basic SharedManifest implementation  
TESTED: manuscript1, manuscript2 - both load successfully
VALIDATED: Rome/ICCU/Monte-Cassino triad unaffected

Files modified:
- EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts (routing case)
- Optional: SharedLibraryDetector.ts (if detection changed)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

#### üîí ROLLBACK PROCEDURE (If things break)
```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts

# 2. Test rollback works  
npm run build && bun test-rome-triad.ts

# 3. Analyze what went wrong
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts

# 4. Create detailed issue analysis
echo "ROUTING ROLLBACK ANALYSIS" > .devkit/analysis/routing-failure-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
echo "What we tried to change: ..." >> .devkit/analysis/routing-failure-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
```

### 2. PROCESS TERMINATION - ZERO TOLERANCE
- **KILLALL FORBIDDEN:** NEVER use `killall electron`, `killall node`, or ANY broad process termination
- **PID-SAFE ONLY:** MUST use PID-safe commands (`npm run test:e2e:kill`)
- **USER PERMISSION REQUIRED:** ALL process termination REQUIRES explicit user approval
- **NO AUTOMATIC CLEANUP:** NEVER terminate processes for "cleanup" - EVER

### 3. DEEP ISSUE ANALYSIS - CRITICAL LESSONS FROM v1.4.192
**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: If users report problems after fixes, PROBLEMS EXIST**

**The v1.4.192 Discovery:**
My initial testing only verified manifest loading, missing the real bugs in download processing. Users continued reporting infinite loops because:
- Issue #29: Download queue success detection was broken (object vs string return)
- Issue #4: Morgan library had ReferenceError in Electron production environment

**MANDATORY Multi-Layer Validation:**
1. **Manifest Loading Test** - Basic functionality 
2. **Download Processing Test** - Full user workflow simulation
3. **Production Environment Test** - Electron-specific issues
4. **User Experience Test** - Complete end-to-end validation

**Testing Framework Requirements - ULTRATHINK AGENTS:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ MANDATORY - Multi-layer approach
1. Basic production code test (manifest loading)
2. Deploy ultrathink agents for DEEP analysis if user reports persist
3. Test actual user workflow, not just individual components
4. Validate in production-like Electron environment
```

**ULTRATHINK AGENT DEPLOYMENT RULES:**
- **ALWAYS deploy when user reports problems after "fixes"**
- **NEVER trust superficial testing** - dig into actual user experience
- **FOCUS on complete user workflow** - manifest ‚Üí download ‚Üí completion
- **ANALYZE production logs** and user-provided error traces

**BUN/ELECTRON TESTING RULES - UPDATED:**
- Use Bun for fast TypeScript component/dev tests: `bun filename.ts`
- For production environment tests (anything importing Electron at runtime, e.g., DownloadLogger/ManifestCache/Queue): always run under Electron main process
  - Commands (added):
    - `npm run test:prod:bordeaux`
    - `npm run test:prod:bordeaux:lite`
    - `npm run test:prod:florence`
  - Implementation: Electron + ts-node transpile-only: `electron -r ts-node/register/transpile-only <ts-entry>`
- Rationale: Bun/Node do not provide Electron's CommonJS exports; running production tests in Electron prevents module resolution failures like "Export named 'app' not found in module 'electron/index.js'"
- **ALWAYS use Bun** for TypeScript testing
- **COMMAND:** `bun filename.ts` to run TypeScript directly  
- **LIMITATION:** Bun tests don't reveal Electron environment issues
- **SOLUTION:** Use ultrathink agents for production environment analysis

### 4. VERSION CONTROL - BULLETPROOF WORKFLOW WITH COMMAND RECOGNITION üéØ

**üö® LESSONS FROM CATASTROPHIC FAILURES APPLIED üö®**

#### üî• USER COMMAND RECOGNITION (LEARNED FROM DISASTERS)
**Version Bump Triggers (execute immediately):**
- **"bump"** - Standard version bump with tracked files only
- **"bump all"** - Comprehensive bump with ALL files (git add -A)
- **"bump version"** - Standard version bump  
- **"bump once more"** - Emergency bump, usually after build failures
- **"don't you understand you need to bump once more??"** - USER IS FRUSTRATED, missed obvious direction
- **"beware previous build failed"** + bump context - FIX with new version
- **"release"** - Full release version bump
- **"approved"** - Permission to execute full workflow

#### üö® COMMAND INTERPRETATION RULES
**Context Clue Detection:**
- Build failure mentions + user prompts = emergency version bump needed
- User frustration language = you missed something obvious
- "once more", "again", "you need to" = clear direction being given

**NEVER ask "should I bump?" when:**
- User already said bump-related commands
- Previous build failed and user is prompting
- User shows frustration about missed directions

**üö® FILE INCLUSION RULES - CATASTROPHIC FAILURES PREVENTION üö®**

**LEARNED FROM BUILD DISASTERS 17258588974, 17259179725:**

```bash
# "bump all" Command Protocol (MANDATORY - USER COMMAND OVERRIDES ALL RESTRICTIONS):
git status --porcelain  # Show what will be included
git add -A             # Stage ALL modifications AND untracked files  
                       # ‚Üë OVERRIDES "FORBIDDEN git add ." rule when user says "all"
npm run precommit      # Quality gates with ALL files staged - MUST PASS
npm run build          # Build verification with ALL files staged - MUST PASS
# Then commit with untracked file disclosure
```

**"bump" vs "bump all" ABSOLUTE Distinction:**
- **"bump"**: Only staged/modified tracked files (`git add -u`)
- **"bump all"**: ALL files including untracked (`git add -A`) 
  - **OVERRIDES**: "FORBIDDEN: git add ." default restriction
  - **PRIORITY**: User explicit command > default automation rules
- **Emergency Context**: Build failures + user direction = assume "bump all" comprehensive fix
- **BUILD SAFETY PRIORITY**: Missing files = build failures = deployment disasters

**Emergency Response for Missing Files:**
1. **IMMEDIATE DETECTION**: Build fails with "Could not resolve" = missing file
2. **RAPID FIX**: `git add missing-file && git commit -m "fix(build): add missing [filename]"`
3. **PUSH IMMEDIATELY**: Don't leave broken build in main branch
4. **PREVENT RECURRENCE**: Update process to catch similar files

**üö® CHANGELOG UPDATE - MANDATORY WITH EVERY VERSION BUMP üö®**
```javascript
// package.json - MUST update when bumping version
"changelog": [
  "v{VERSION}: Brief title of changes",
  "Major fix or feature 1 description",
  "Major fix or feature 2 description",
  "UI/UX improvements if any",
  "Performance improvements if any"
]
```
- **CRITICAL:** Changelog NOT updating = Telegram sends OLD version info
- **ALWAYS:** Update to current version number
- **ALWAYS:** Replace entire array with current version's changes
- **NEVER:** Leave old version numbers in changelog

**Version Bump Triggers (execute immediately when user approves):**
- Bug fixes affecting functionality
- New features or improvements
- Library additions/fixes
- Performance improvements
- When user explicitly says "bump", "release", or "approved"

**Complete Version Bump Workflow (MANDATORY):**
1. **FILE STAGING**: `git add -A` if "bump all", `git add -u` if just "bump"
2. **QUALITY GATES**: `npm run precommit` with ALL files staged
3. **BUILD VERIFICATION**: `npm run build` with ALL files staged
4. Update package.json version number
5. Update changelog with clear user benefits
6. Commit with descriptive message (include untracked files list)
7. **Push to GitHub immediately**
8. Monitor `gh run list` for build status
9. Verify Telegram notification sent
10. Report success/failure to user

**NOT Version Bump Triggers:**
- Documentation changes (unless requested)
- Telegram bot fixes
- Code refactoring without behavior changes

### 4.1. COMMIT & PUSH STRATEGY - BUILD-SAFE WORKFLOW
- **VERSION BUMPS OVERRIDE**: For version bumps, `git add -A` is MANDATORY when user says "bump all"
- **QUALITY GATES FIRST**: Run precommit + build with ALL files staged BEFORE committing
- **BUILD SAFETY PRIORITY**: Missing files = build failures = deployment disasters
- **PARALLEL WORK SAFETY**: Use feature branches for experimental work, not main branch restrictions
- **VERIFICATION**: Monitor GitHub Actions (gh run list) and confirm Telegram sent
- **FALLBACK**: If Bash fails, create Node.js script (.cjs) with `child_process.execSync()`

### 5. LIBRARY VALIDATION PROTOCOL - 100% SUCCESS REQUIRED
**MANDATORY Steps (except in `/handle-issues` workflow):**
1. **MAXIMUM RESOLUTION TESTING:** Test ALL IIIF parameters (full/full, full/max, full/2000, full/4000) - users MUST get highest quality
2. Download 10 different pages using HIGHEST resolution found
3. Verify DIFFERENT manuscript content on each page (not stuck on page 1)
4. Merge to PDF and validate with poppler
5. **CLAUDE MUST INSPECT:** Before showing user, MUST verify:
   - File size with `ls -la` (0-byte = failure)
   - PDF structure with `pdfimages -list`
   - Visual content with `pdfimages -png` + Read tool
   - DIFFERENT pages (no duplicates)
   - NO "Preview non disponibile" or auth errors
   - Rate result: ["failed", "something not ok", "ok"]
6. **USER VALIDATION FOLDER:** Create SINGLE clean `.devkit/validation/READY-FOR-USER/` with ONLY final PDFs
7. **VERSION BUMP:** User saying "bump" or "approved" IS the approval - execute full workflow immediately

### 6. AUTO-SPLIT CONFIGURATION - CRITICAL FOR LARGE MANUSCRIPTS
**MANDATORY: All libraries MUST be included in auto-split logic to prevent download failures**

**Location:** `src/main/services/EnhancedDownloadQueue.ts` lines 1354-1403

**When adding a new library:**
1. Add library name to `estimatedSizeLibraries` array (line 1356-1363)
2. Add page size estimation in `avgPageSizeMB` calculation (lines 1368-1403)
3. Use realistic estimates based on library's typical resolution:
   - High-res archives (Parker, Roman Archive): 2.0-2.2 MB/page
   - Major libraries (BL, LoC, Bodleian): 1.2-1.5 MB/page  
   - Standard IIIF libraries: 0.6-1.0 MB/page
   - Mobile/compressed: 0.3-0.5 MB/page

**Why this matters:**
- Without auto-split: Downloads fail for manuscripts > 300MB
- Users see: 800MB single downloads that crash (Mac) or 1.5MB incomplete files (Windows)
- With auto-split: Large manuscripts split into 30MB chunks that download reliably

**Common mistake:** Forgetting to add new libraries causes catastrophic download failures

### 7. FILE ORGANIZATION - ZERO ROOT CLUTTER
**MANDATORY Structure:**
```
.devkit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation/     # PDF validation files ONLY
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/        # Test scripts ONLY  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/        # Utility scripts ONLY
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/           # Documentation ONLY
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/        # Generated reports ONLY
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/          # Todo management ONLY
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator/   # Handle-issues workflow ONLY
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/       # Claude command scripts ONLY
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/      # Temporary files ONLY
```

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN in root:**
- ‚ùå ANY validation folders
- ‚ùå ANY test scripts
- ‚ùå ANY utility scripts (except standard build)
- ‚ùå ANY documentation reports
- ‚ùå ANY temporary files

**ANTI-ACCUMULATION RULES:**
- **LIMITS:** 200 files max, 200MB max in `.devkit/`
- **LIFECYCLE:** CREATE ‚Üí USE ‚Üí DELETE immediately
- **CLEANUP:** Delete after EVERY task completion
- **PWD CHECK:** If files "missing", IMMEDIATELY run `pwd` to verify location

### 8. PRE-PUSH QUALITY GATES - BULLETPROOF ENFORCEMENT FROM DISASTERS üõ°Ô∏èüí•

**üö® CATASTROPHIC LESSON LEARNED: NEVER BYPASS PRECOMMIT FAILURES üö®**
**Disaster Reference: User had to say "this is critical!!!!" to stop me from bypassing**

#### üõë PRECOMMIT FAILURE = FULL SYSTEM SHUTDOWN
```
üö®üö®üö® IF npm run precommit FAILS: üö®üö®üö®
   ‚ùå STOP ALL VERSION BUMP ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY
   ‚ùå STOP ALL GIT COMMITS IMMEDIATELY  
   ‚ùå STOP ALL BUILD ATTEMPTS IMMEDIATELY
   ‚ùå NO "build passes anyway" logic EVER ALLOWED
   ‚ùå NO "types don't matter" reasoning EVER ALLOWED
   ‚ùå NO "we can fix later" postponement EVER ALLOWED
   ‚úÖ FIX TYPE ERRORS FIRST - NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
   ‚úÖ Use npm run typefix + npm run typecheck
   ‚úÖ Only proceed after precommit shows 0 errors
```

#### üß† FORBIDDEN DISASTER THINKING (That Led to Failures)
**These thoughts are now BANNED:**
- "Build passes so type errors don't matter" ‚Üê CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG - caused production crashes
- "Type errors are just warnings" ‚Üê CAUSES RUNTIME FAILURES in Electron  
- "We can fix types later" ‚Üê NEVER ACCEPTABLE - fix NOW
- "User is waiting, skip type safety" ‚Üê USER PREFERS WORKING CODE over fast broken code
- "It works in dev so types don't matter" ‚Üê PRODUCTION != DEV environment

#### üèóÔ∏è MANDATORY QUALITY GATE SEQUENCE
```bash
# BULLETPROOF SEQUENCE - NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED
1. npm run precommit    # MUST show 0 errors - FULL STOP if fails
2. npm run lint         # MUST pass with zero errors  
3. npm run build        # MUST complete successfully
4. git commit          # ONLY if ALL gates pass
5. git push            # Deploy only verified code
```

#### üöë PRECOMMIT FAILURE EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
```bash
# When precommit fails (MANDATORY RESPONSE):
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY - no other actions allowed
2. npm run typefix     # Auto-fix attempt
3. npm run typecheck   # Verify fix worked  
4. IF STILL FAILING: Manual type fixes required
5. REPEAT until precommit passes 100%
6. ONLY THEN resume version bump process
```

**CRITICAL FAILURE PATTERNS NOW IMPOSSIBLE:**
- ‚ùå Seeing precommit errors and continuing anyway ‚Üê BLOCKED by immediate stop protocol
- ‚ùå "Build passes so type errors don't matter" ‚Üê BANNED thinking pattern
- ‚ùå Ignoring type safety for speed ‚Üê Quality over speed always
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS fix type errors before any commit ‚Üê ONLY acceptable pattern

**After push (unchanged):**
1. Verify GitHub Actions build success
2. Check telegram notifications sent
3. If build fails: fix, commit, push fixes

### 9. OUTPUT DISCIPLINE - MINIMAL VERBOSITY
- **NEVER display:** Raw tool outputs, full file contents, verbose logs
- **ALWAYS summarize:** "Found X changes", "Command successful", specific errors only
- **CRITICAL errors only:** Maximum 3-5 lines when troubleshooting

### 10. TELEGRAM CHANGELOG - USER-FACING CLARITY
**MUST provide specific benefits:**
- ‚úÖ "Added Vatican Library manuscript downloads"
- ‚úÖ "Fixed hanging downloads for large Graz manuscripts"
- ‚ùå "Bug fixes and improvements"
- ‚ùå "Library support enhancements"

**Parse semantically:** Convert technical ‚Üí user benefits

### 11. MEANINGFUL LOGGING - NO MORE USELESS MESSAGES
**MANDATORY: All logs must answer WHO/WHAT/WHERE/WHEN/WHY/HOW**

**Location:** `src/main/services/EnhancedLogger.ts`

**BAD logging (current state):**
```
[INFO] Download started
[INFO] Download completed
```

**GOOD logging (required):**
```
[QUEUE] Adding Roman Archive: Lectionarium Novum (383 pages, ~843MB, will split into 28 parts)
[MANIFEST] Roman Archive: Found 383 pages via HTML parsing in 0.4s
[DOWNLOAD] Starting Roman Archive - Part 1/28 (pages 1-14) (~30.1MB)
[PROGRESS] Roman Archive - Part 1/28: 50% (7/14 pages, 15.4MB, 1.2MB/s, ETA 6s)
[ERROR] Roman Archive - Part 2/28: SocketError after 5.2s, retrying (attempt 2/11)
[SUCCESS] Roman Archive - Part 1/28 complete: 30.1MB in 25.3s (1.2MB/s)
[COMPLETE] Roman Archive: 383 pages (841.7MB) in 12m 34s (1.1MB/s, 3 retries)
```

**Required information in logs:**
- Library name and manuscript ID
- Total pages and size
- Chunk information (current/total)
- Progress percentage and speed
- Error details with retry info
- Duration and performance metrics

**Common mistake:** Using console.log('Download started') instead of enhancedLogger

### 12. DEVELOPMENT SERVER POLICY
- **NEVER start automatically** - requires explicit user request
- `npm run dev` - ONLY when user requests UI
- `npm run dev:headless` - ONLY for explicit validation

## üé≠ Handle-Issues Command v5.0 - Layered Validation with Ultrathink

The `/handle-issues` command now uses **Multi-Layer Validation with Ultrathink Agents** based on lessons from v1.4.192.

### How Claude Should Respond to /handle-issues

**PHASE 1: Initial Assessment**
1. **Fetch ALL open issues** comprehensively
2. **Basic production code testing** (manifest loading verification)
3. **Create issue status report** - preliminary analysis

**PHASE 2: User Persistence Check** 
```
IF users report problems AFTER claimed fixes:
  ‚Üí DEPLOY ULTRATHINK AGENTS immediately
  ‚Üí NEVER argue "it should work"
  ‚Üí DIG DEEPER into actual user workflow
ELSE:
  ‚Üí Standard notification process
```

**PHASE 3: Ultrathink Deep Analysis**
For each persistent issue:
- **Agent Mission**: Find exact root cause in full user workflow
- **Focus Areas**: Download processing, IPC communication, production environment
- **Required Output**: Specific code fixes with exact line numbers
- **Validation**: Must reproduce user's exact problem first

**PHASE 4: Real Fixes Implementation**
- Apply ultrathink agent discoveries  
- Test complete user workflow (not just components)
- Version bump ONLY when real fixes exist
- Update users with technical details of actual fixes

### Expected Todos Structure v5.0
```
‚òê Multi-Layer Issue Resolution
  ‚òê Phase 1: Initial Assessment  
    ‚òê Fetch all open issues
    ‚òê Basic production testing (manifest loading)

### Files and Paths
- **Command Script**: `.devkit/commands/handle-issues.sh`
- **Orchestrator**: `.devkit/scripts/orchestrated-issue-resolver.cjs`
- **Issue Analyzer**: `.devkit/scripts/enhanced-issue-analyzer.cjs`
- **Reports**: `.devkit/orchestrator/fix-report.json`
- **Agent Workspaces**: `.devkit/orchestrator/agent-{issue-number}/`

### Key Principles v5.0 - Lessons from v1.4.192
- **User Reports = Truth**: If users report problems after fixes, problems exist
- **Multi-Layer Testing**: Manifest ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Production ‚Üí User Experience  
- **Ultrathink When Needed**: Deploy agents for persistent issues
- **Real Fixes Only**: Version bump only when genuine code fixes exist
- **Complete Workflow Focus**: Test full user experience, not just components
- **Production Environment**: Consider Electron/Windows specific issues
- **Technical Transparency**: Update users with exact technical details of fixes

## Agent Management (Legacy - for other workflows)
- Default: 5 parallel agents (user can specify)
- Split work into phases for different agents
- Agents write large findings to `.devkit/` subfolders
- Each agent works silently - no terminal output

## TODO Management Commands
- `/user:todo [task]` - Add todo
- `/user:handle-todos` - Handle first pending  
- `/user:list-todos` - Show all pending
- Completed todos ‚Üí `.devkit/tasks/COMPLETED.md`
