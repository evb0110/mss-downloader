## Recommendation

**✅ APPROVE FOR VERSION BUMP**

**Rationale:**
1. **All fixes properly implemented** - Code analysis confirms correct implementation
2. **Working libraries confirmed** - User testing validates accessibility  
3. **PDF validation successful** - University of Graz demonstrates quality
4. **Server issues are external** - Not related to code fixes
5. **Error handling improved** - Better user experience for server issues

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ User approval received for University of Graz
2. 🎯 **AWAITING USER APPROVAL** for version bump
3. 📦 Bump patch version after approval
4. 🚀 Commit and push changes
5. 📢 Telegram bot changelog notification
