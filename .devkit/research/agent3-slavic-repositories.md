2. **Russian State Library** - Large digitized collection, technical assessment required
3. **Polish National Library (Polona)** - IIIF confirmed, Cyrillic extent verification needed
4. **Library of Congress St. Catherine's Collection** - Unique historical content

### **Research Phase (LOW Priority)**
1. **Austrian National Library** - Collection scope assessment needed
2. **Bulgarian National Library** - Technical capabilities unknown
3. **Swedish Slavic Projects** - Academic collection, limited scope

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### **Authentication Requirements**
- Russian institutions may require registration or have access restrictions
- Post-Soviet archives may have political/cultural access limitations
- Some collections may be restricted to reading rooms only

### **Technical Challenges**
- **Cyrillic Metadata Encoding:** Verify Unicode support in IIIF metadata
- **Multiple Script Systems:** Support for Cyrillic, Glagolitic, and Latin scripts
- **Recension Variations:** Different Church Slavonic traditions (Serbian, Bulgarian, Russian)

### **Content Quality Considerations**
- **Manuscript Dating:** Wide range from 10th to 19th centuries
- **Condition Variation:** Some manuscripts may have poor digitization quality
- **Liturgical Focus:** High concentration of religious texts vs. secular manuscripts

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### **IIIF Manifest URL Patterns**
- Harvard: `https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:{identifier}`
- Manuscriptorium: Platform-specific IDs with test manifest endpoints
- Bavarian State Library: Munich DigitiZation Center infrastructure

### **Language Detection Requirements**
The downloader should support identification of:
- Church Slavonic (various recensions)
- Old Church Slavonic
- Serbian Church Slavonic
- Russian Church Slavonic
- Bulgarian Church Slavonic
- Glagolitic script variants

### **Metadata Standards**
Most institutions follow Dublin Core or MODS metadata standards with IIIF Presentation API compliance for technical metadata.

## CONCLUSION

The research identified a rich ecosystem of Slavic manuscript digitization efforts with varying levels of IIIF adoption. **Manuscriptorium and Harvard University Library** represent the most immediately integrable sources, providing verified IIIF access to significant Church Slavonic collections.

The **Czech National Library's Manuscriptorium** emerges as the premier platform for Slavic manuscript access, offering both breadth (111,000+ items) and technical sophistication (full IIIF implementation).

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Manuscriptorium and Harvard integrations first
2. Verify IIIF capabilities at Russian and German institutions  
3. Develop Cyrillic metadata parsing capabilities
4. Create specialized loaders for Church Slavonic manuscript identification

**Mission Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive Slavic repository landscape mapped with actionable integration pathways identified.
