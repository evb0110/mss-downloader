# Fix Summary for GitHub Issues

## Issue #1: HHU Manifest Loading Failure

### Root Cause
The `detectLibrary()` function in `EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts` is **missing HHU URL detection**. When a user tries to load an HHU URL like `https://digital.ulb.hhu.de/ms/content/titleinfo/7674176`, the function returns `null`, causing the error "Unsupported library for URL".

### Required Fix
Add HHU detection to the `detectLibrary()` function:
```typescript
if (url.includes('digital.ulb.hhu.de')) return 'hhu';
```

This needs to be added to the list of library checks in the `detectLibrary()` function around line 1040.

## Issue #2: Critical Code Issues

### Missing HHU in detectLibrary
Despite having a full implementation of `loadHhuManifest()` and proper case handling in the switch statement, the library detection is missing, making HHU completely unusable.

## Issue #3: Verona/NBM Italy Timeout

The logs show this is actually a different issue - the user was testing Morgan (which works) and NBM Italy. Need to investigate NBM Italy specifically.

## Version Confusion

Users are on v1.4.41 which claims to have fixed these issues, but the fix for HHU library detection is clearly missing from the code. This suggests the fix was either:
1. Not properly implemented
2. Accidentally reverted
3. Lost during a merge

## Immediate Action Required

1. Add HHU detection to `detectLibrary()` function
2. Test with the exact URLs from the issues
3. Verify NBM Italy/Verona timeout handling
4. Create proper validation tests
5. Bump version after fixes are confirmed working
