# GitHub Issues Log Analysis Report

## Summary
Both users are running version 1.4.41 (latest) on Windows, but experiencing different issues than expected.

## Issue #1: HHU (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf)
- **User Version:** 1.4.41 (current latest)
- **Platform:** Windows x64
- **URL:** https://digital.ulb.hhu.de/ms/content/titleinfo/7674176
- **Problem:** Manifest loading started but no completion or error logged
- **Key Finding:** The log shows only the start of manifest loading with no subsequent success/error messages, suggesting the process is hanging

## Issue #3: Verona (actually showing Morgan Library logs)
- **User Version:** 1.4.41 (current latest)  
- **Platform:** Windows x64
- **URLs Tested:**
  - Morgan Library: https://www.themorgan.org/collection/lindau-gospels (SUCCESS)
  - NBM Italy: https://www.nuovabibliotecamanoscritta.it/... (log cuts off)
- **Key Findings:**
  1. Morgan Library successfully loaded manifest in ~1 second
  2. Morgan Library download completed successfully (11KB HTML)
  3. NBM Italy started loading but log cuts off (likely the actual failure)

## Critical Observations

### 1. Version Mismatch
Both users are on v1.4.41, but recent commits show:
- v1.4.39: "Fix critical GitHub issues - HHU, Graz, Verona, Morgan"
- v1.4.38: "Fix critical library issues - NBM Italy, Morgan, Graz, HHU"
- v1.4.37: "Fix Morgan Library page extraction"

**PROBLEM:** Users are running a NEWER version (1.4.41) than the fixes (1.4.39)!

### 2. Missing Error Handling
HHU log shows manifest loading started but no error/success - suggests infinite hang or crash without proper error logging.

### 3. Wrong Library in Verona Issue
The Verona issue log actually shows Morgan Library (working) and NBM Italy (possibly failing), not Verona-specific URLs.

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Check current version in package.json** - confirm if 1.4.41 exists
2. **Review commits between 1.4.39 and 1.4.41** - something may have broken the fixes
3. **Test HHU URL locally** - reproduce the hanging issue
4. **Get complete logs** - current logs are truncated/incomplete

## Hypothesis
The fixes in v1.4.39 may have been overwritten or broken by subsequent changes in v1.4.40 or v1.4.41.
