## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: HHU Manifest Loading Hangs

**Symptom:** Manifest loading starts but never completes, no error logged
**URL:** https://digital.ulb.hhu.de/ms/content/titleinfo/7674176

**Code Flow:**
1. `EnhancedDownloadQueue.loadManifestForItem()` is called
2. Logs "Starting manifest load for queue item" 
3. Calls `this.currentDownloader.loadManifest(item.url, progressCallback)`
4. This should eventually call `EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.loadHhuManifest()`
5. But the process hangs somewhere before reaching HHU-specific code

**Likely Issue:** The manifest loading is hanging in the generic manifest detection/routing code before it reaches the HHU-specific handler.

### Issue #3: Verona/NBM Italy Issue

**Symptom:** Morgan Library works fine, but NBM Italy starts loading then cuts off
**Analysis:** The log shows Morgan working perfectly but NBM Italy manifest loading started without completion

## Key Finding: Library Detection Issue

The problem appears to be in the library detection mechanism. When a URL is passed to `loadManifest()`, it needs to:
1. Detect which library it belongs to
2. Route to the appropriate handler

But for HHU, the detection might be failing because:
- The URL format `https://digital.ulb.hhu.de/ms/content/titleinfo/7674176` doesn't match expected patterns
- The library detection in `getLibraryFromUrl()` returns null
- The manifest loading then falls into a default handler that hangs

## Verification Needed

1. Check if `getLibraryFromUrl()` properly detects HHU URLs
2. Check if the manifest loading has proper error handling for unrecognized libraries
3. Test the actual HHU URL locally to reproduce the hang

## Fix Strategy

1. Ensure HHU URL patterns are properly detected in `getLibraryFromUrl()`
2. Add timeout and error handling to prevent infinite hangs
3. Add proper logging when library detection fails
4. Test with actual HHU URLs to verify the fix works
