# 🔄 Cache Clear Instructions - BDL Fix Not Working

## ✅ Code Verification Complete
- `formatTime` method: ✅ Present in dist/main/main.js (line 66615)
- Promise chain: ✅ Present in dist/main/main.js (line 66532) 
- Build successful: ✅ All caches cleared and rebuilt

## 🚨 Issue: App Still Using Old Code

**Root Cause**: Electron app is likely running from cached memory/previous instance

## 📋 Required Steps

### Step 1: Complete App Restart
```bash
# Make sure no Electron processes are running
ps aux | grep -i electron
ps aux | grep -i mss-downloader

# Kill any remaining processes if found
# pkill -f "mss-downloader"  (if needed)
```

### Step 2: Clear Electron App Data  
The app may have cached the old queue logic in its internal storage.

**Option A: Clear app storage via UI**
- Look for "Clear Cache" or "Reset" options in the app settings

**Option B: Delete Electron app data** (if Option A doesn't exist)
```bash
# Clear Electron app data (varies by system)
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/*mss-downloader* 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/*mss-downloader* 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 3: Fresh App Launch
After clearing:
1. Launch the app fresh
2. Try adding a BDL manuscript 
3. Click "Start" on individual parts first (to test basic functionality)
4. Then try "Start simultaneously" on multiple parts

## 🔍 Debugging Next Steps

**If still not working after cache clear:**

1. **Check logs**: Look for our new log messages in the console:
   - Should see: `Processing auto-split part: BDL_3903_Part_X`
   - Should see: ETA with units like "2m 30s" instead of just "2"

2. **Test individual vs simultaneous**:
   - Individual START buttons → Should work immediately
   - "Start simultaneously" → Should start all parts at once

3. **Check for error messages**: 
   - Console might show "Setup failed" errors if there are still issues
   - Look for timeout or manifest loading errors

## 💡 Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Click "Start simultaneously" → All 9 parts begin downloading immediately
- ✅ ETA shows "45s", "2m 15s" etc. (not raw numbers)
- ✅ Multiple downloads progress concurrently (not one-by-one)
- ✅ No infinite loops or hanging at 100%
