# Library Fixes Summary - VERSION 1.4.21

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ BDL Servizirl - Invalid URL Format Issue
- **Problem**: New BDL URLs like `https://www.bdl.servizirl.it/vufind/Record/BDL-OGGETTO-3903` were not recognized
- **Solution**: Added support for vufind URL format with regex pattern matching
- **Code**: Enhanced `loadBDLManifest` to extract manuscript ID from both old and new URL formats

### 2. ‚úÖ Verona Biblioteca - Connection Timeout Issue  
- **Problem**: `connect ETIMEDOUT 89.17.160.89:443`
- **Solution**: Switched to `fetchWithHTTPS` for SSL/TLS handling
- **Code**: Updated manifest loading to use HTTPS module with proper SSL handling

### 3. ‚úÖ Klosterneuburg (Vienna Manuscripta) - Hanging Downloads
- **Problem**: Downloads would hang after several manuscripts
- **Solution**: Added progress monitoring with 4-minute timeout
- **Code**: Added `vienna_manuscripta` to IntelligentProgressMonitor configuration

### 4. ‚úÖ BNE Spain - Hanging Without Progress
- **Problem**: Page discovery process would hang
- **Solution**: Added progress monitoring with 3-minute timeout
- **Code**: Integrated createProgressMonitor into `robustBneDiscovery` method

### 5. ‚úÖ MDC Catalonia - Connection Timeout Issue
- **Problem**: `connect ETIMEDOUT 193.240.184.109:443`
- **Solution**: Already configured to use `fetchWithHTTPS`, added progress monitoring
- **Code**: Added `mdc_catalonia` to progress monitor with 5-minute timeout

### 6. ‚úÖ Grenoble - DNS Resolution Issue
- **Problem**: `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN pagella.bm-grenoble.fr`
- **Solution**: Added DNS pre-resolution like Graz
- **Code**: Pre-resolve DNS before HTTPS requests to avoid EAI_AGAIN errors

### 7. ‚úÖ Karlsruhe - Add Direct URL Support
- **Problem**: Only i3f viewer URLs worked, not direct BLB URLs
- **Solution**: Added pattern matching for `digital.blb-karlsruhe.de/blbhs/content/titleinfo/`
- **Code**: Enhanced URL detection and manifest URL construction

### 8. ‚úÖ Florence - Fetch Failed Issue
- **Problem**: HTTP/HTTPS connection issues
- **Solution**: Switched to `fetchWithHTTPS` and updated all URLs to HTTPS
- **Code**: Changed all cdm21059.contentdm.oclc.org URLs from HTTP to HTTPS

### 9. ‚úÖ Library of Congress - Hanging on Calculation
- **Problem**: Large manifests would timeout during processing
- **Solution**: Added progress monitoring with 6-minute timeout
- **Code**: Integrated progress updates during manifest parsing

### 10. ‚úÖ University of Graz - Timeout for Large Manuscripts
- **Problem**: Very large IIIF manifests (289KB+) timing out
- **Solution**: Extended timeouts to 15 minutes (was 10)
- **Code**: Updated both IntelligentProgressMonitor and loadGrazManifest timeouts

## üìä Technical Improvements

### Progress Monitoring Enhanced For:
- BNE Spain (3 min timeout)
- MDC Catalonia (5 min timeout)  
- Vienna Manuscripta (4 min timeout)
- Library of Congress (6 min timeout)
- University of Graz (15 min timeout - extended)

### Network Handling Improved:
- Verona: SSL/TLS via fetchWithHTTPS
- Grenoble: DNS pre-resolution
- Florence: HTTPS migration
- MDC Catalonia: Already using fetchWithHTTPS

### URL Format Support Added:
- BDL: New vufind format (`/vufind/Record/BDL-OGGETTO-XXXX`)
- Karlsruhe: Direct BLB URLs (`/blbhs/content/titleinfo/XXXX`)

## üß™ Validation Instructions

To validate these fixes:

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test each URL manually** from the provided test URLs
3. **Download 10 pages** for each library
4. **Verify**:
   - No timeouts or hanging
   - PDF quality is high
   - All pages are different
   - No authentication errors

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Check PDF validity
pdfinfo downloaded.pdf

# Extract and check image quality  
pdfimages -list downloaded.pdf
pdfimages -png downloaded.pdf output

# Check file size
ls -lah downloaded.pdf
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

Each library should:
- ‚úÖ Load manifest without timeout
- ‚úÖ Show progress updates during download
- ‚úÖ Complete download successfully
- ‚úÖ Generate valid PDF (poppler validation)
- ‚úÖ Contain high-quality images
- ‚úÖ Show different content on each page

## üìù Notes

All fixes follow the established patterns:
- Using existing `fetchWithHTTPS` for SSL issues
- Leveraging `IntelligentProgressMonitor` for timeout management
- Minimal code changes for maximum compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
