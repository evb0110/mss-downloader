# Precommit Zero Tolerance - Bulletproof Enforcement

**üö® CATASTROPHIC LESSON LEARNED: NEVER bypass precommit failures üö®**
**Disaster Reference: User had to say "this is critical!!!!" to stop me from bypassing**

## Precommit Failure = Full System Shutdown

```
üö®üö®üö® IF npm run precommit FAILS: üö®üö®üö®
   ‚ùå STOP ALL VERSION BUMP ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY
   ‚ùå STOP ALL GIT COMMITS IMMEDIATELY  
   ‚ùå STOP ALL BUILD ATTEMPTS IMMEDIATELY
   ‚ùå NO "build passes anyway" logic EVER ALLOWED
   ‚ùå NO "types don't matter" reasoning EVER ALLOWED
   ‚ùå NO "we can fix later" postponement EVER ALLOWED
   ‚úÖ FIX TYPE ERRORS FIRST - NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
   ‚úÖ Use npm run typefix + npm run typecheck
   ‚úÖ Only proceed after precommit shows 0 errors
```

## Forbidden Disaster Thinking (That Led to Failures)

**These thoughts are now BANNED:**
- "Build passes so type errors don't matter" ‚Üê CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG - caused production crashes
- "Type errors are just warnings" ‚Üê CAUSES RUNTIME FAILURES in Electron  
- "We can fix types later" ‚Üê NEVER ACCEPTABLE - fix NOW
- "User is waiting, skip type safety" ‚Üê USER PREFERS WORKING CODE over fast broken code
- "It works in dev so types don't matter" ‚Üê PRODUCTION != DEV environment

## Mandatory Quality Gate Sequence

```bash
# BULLETPROOF SEQUENCE - NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED
1. npm run precommit    # MUST show 0 errors - FULL STOP if fails
2. npm run lint         # MUST pass with zero errors  
3. npm run build        # MUST complete successfully
4. git commit          # ONLY if ALL gates pass
5. git push            # Deploy only verified code
```

## Precommit Failure Emergency Protocol

```bash
# When precommit fails (MANDATORY RESPONSE):
1. STOP IMMEDIATELY - no other actions allowed
2. npm run typefix     # Auto-fix attempt
3. npm run typecheck   # Verify fix worked  
4. IF STILL FAILING: Manual type fixes required
5. REPEAT until precommit passes 100%
6. ONLY THEN resume version bump process
```

## Critical Failure Patterns Now Impossible

- ‚ùå Seeing precommit errors and continuing anyway ‚Üê BLOCKED by immediate stop protocol
- ‚ùå "Build passes so type errors don't matter" ‚Üê BANNED thinking pattern
- ‚ùå Ignoring type safety for speed ‚Üê Quality over speed always
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS fix type errors before any commit ‚Üê ONLY acceptable pattern

## After Push (unchanged)

1. Verify GitHub Actions build success
2. Check telegram notifications sent
3. If build fails: fix, commit, push fixes
