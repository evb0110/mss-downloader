## Previous Completed Tasks

## 2025-06-29

✅ **Implement intelligent download progress monitoring with timeout detection (2025-06-29)**
  - **Issue:** Current University of Graz timeout fix uses random 2-minute timeout instead of intelligent monitoring
  - **Solution:** Implemented comprehensive intelligent progress monitoring system with interval checking
  - **Features:** 
    - Always waits initial period (2 minutes) before starting monitoring
    - Uses 30-second interval checking to detect progress vs stuck downloads
    - Distinguishes between slow but progressing vs truly stuck downloads
    - Library-specific timeout optimizations (Graz: 10min, Manuscripta: 5min, Trinity: 6min)
    - Enhanced user feedback with context-aware progress messages
    - Robust error handling with graceful degradation

✅ **Fix persistent Telegram bot generic message issue - Comprehensive changelog generation fix (2025-06-30)**
  - **Issue:** Despite multiple fixes, v1.3.62 sent generic "New functionality and features" instead of specific library details
  - **Root Cause:** Library detection failures in semantic parsing logic - missing/incorrect library mappings
  - **Problems Identified:**
    - "Monte-Cassino" (hyphen) didn't match "monte cassino" (space) in mappings
    - "Verona NBM" missing from library mappings entirely  
    - Duplicate "Verona Biblioteca" vs "Verona National Library" entries
    - Parsing logic split on hyphens, breaking compound library names
  - **Solution:** Enhanced semantic parsing with comprehensive library mappings and improved matching
  - **Files Modified:** telegram-bot/src/send-multiplatform-build.ts
