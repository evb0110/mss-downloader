## Previous Completed Tasks

## 2025-06-29

✅ **Implement intelligent download progress monitoring with timeout detection (2025-06-29)**
  - **Issue:** Current University of Graz timeout fix uses random 2-minute timeout instead of intelligent monitoring
  - **Solution:** Implemented comprehensive intelligent progress monitoring system with interval checking
  - **Features:** 
    - Always waits initial period (2 minutes) before starting monitoring
    - Uses 30-second interval checking to detect progress vs stuck downloads
    - Distinguishes between slow but progressing vs truly stuck downloads
    - Library-specific timeout optimizations (Graz: 10min, Manuscripta: 5min, Trinity: 6min)
    - Enhanced user feedback with context-aware progress messages
    - Robust error handling with graceful degradation
  - **Files Created:** IntelligentProgressMonitor.ts, ProgressMonitoringService.ts, DownloadProgressIntegration.ts

  - **Version:** v1.3.58

✅ **Fix persistent Telegram bot generic message issue - Comprehensive changelog generation fix (2025-06-30)**
  - **Issue:** Despite multiple fixes, v1.3.62 sent generic "New functionality and features" instead of specific library details
  - **Root Cause:** Library detection failures in semantic parsing logic - missing/incorrect library mappings
  - **Problems Identified:**
    - "Monte-Cassino" (hyphen) didn't match "monte cassino" (space) in mappings
    - "Verona NBM" missing from library mappings entirely  
    - Duplicate "Verona Biblioteca" vs "Verona National Library" entries
    - Parsing logic split on hyphens, breaking compound library names
  - **Solution:** Enhanced semantic parsing with comprehensive library mappings and improved matching
  - **Files Modified:** telegram-bot/src/send-multiplatform-build.ts
  - **Fixes Applied:**
    - Added missing library variants: "monte-cassino", "verona nbm", "vallicelliana library"
    - Unified Verona entries to "Verona National Library (Italy)"
    - Enhanced extractLibrariesFromDescription with longest-first matching
    - Improved regex patterns with flexible hyphen/space handling
    - Enhanced parseSemanticComponents for multi-library commits

  - **Version:** v1.3.55

✅ **Fix Manuscripta.at hanging downloads - Resolved page-specific URL hanging (2025-06-29)**
  - **Issue:** Downloads hang at page 437 of 782, page range selection not working
  - **URL:** https://manuscripta.at/diglit/AT5000-963/0001
  - **Root Cause:** Pre-filtering pageLinks array in manifest loading, creating mismatch between expected and available pages
  - **Solution:** Removed pre-filtering logic, store page range info for later processing
  - **Files Modified:** EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts (lines 4233-4249, 4314-4331), types.ts (line 34)
  - **Impact:** Manuscripts no longer hang when page-specific URLs are used
  - **Version:** v1.3.55

✅ **Fix e-manuscripta.ch single page bug - 468x content improvement (2025-06-29)**
  - **Issue:** Only downloads first page instead of complete manuscript (99.8% data loss)
  - **URL:** https://www.e-manuscripta.ch/zuzcmi/content/zoom/3229497
  - **Root Cause:** Incorrect page discovery using naive regex instead of parsing actual page dropdown
  - **Solution:** Extract complete goToPage select element and parse actual page IDs
  - **Files Modified:** EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts (lines 5182-5242)
  - **Impact:** 468x improvement - now detects 468 pages instead of 1 (from 99.8% data loss to 100% accuracy)
  - **Version:** v1.3.55

  - **URL:** http://digitale.bnc.roma.sbn.it/tecadigitale/manoscrittoantico/BNCR_Ms_SESS_0062/BNCR_Ms_SESS_0062/1
  - **Root Cause:** Using `/max` endpoint which returns HTML, falling back to `/full`
  - **Solution:** Changed to `/original` endpoint for highest quality images
  - **Result:** 2.83x larger file sizes with significantly better resolution
  - **Files Modified:** EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts
  - **Impact:** Users get highest quality manuscripts available from BNC Roma

  - **URL:** https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/446/CNMD_0000171876
  - **Root Cause:** Assigning IIIF label object `{ "@value": "string" }` to displayName instead of extracting the string value
  - **Solution:** Added proper type checking and string extraction from IIIF label array format
  - **Files Modified:** EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts (line 4904-4912)
  - **Impact:** Europeana manuscripts now load correctly without JavaScript errors

✅ **Fix Morgan Library image quality - Low resolution downloads (2025-06-28)**
  - **Issue:** Downloads 55KB thumbnails instead of 280KB high-resolution originals
  - **URL:** https://www.themorgan.org/collection/lindau-gospels/thumbs
