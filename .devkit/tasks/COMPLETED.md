# Completed Tasks

## 2025-07-26: Morgan Library Page Extraction Fix

### Tasks Completed:
1. ✅ Investigated Morgan Library - user reports only 1 page download offered
2. ✅ Checked Morgan Library implementation for page counting issues
3. ✅ Tested Morgan Library with multiple manuscripts
4. ✅ Fixed the issue and validated with proper PDFs

### Implementation Details:
- **Root Cause**: Code was automatically appending "/thumbs" to Morgan URLs, which now causes redirects or returns incomplete data
- **Fix Applied**: Removed automatic "/thumbs" appending - now uses main collection page directly
- **Page Extraction**: Fixed to properly extract individual page URLs from main collection page

### Validation Results:
- **Lindau Gospels**: Now correctly extracts 16 pages (previously only 1)
- **Arenberg Gospels**: Now correctly extracts 12 pages (previously only 1)
- **Hours of Catherine of Cleves**: Now correctly extracts 15 pages
- All PDFs validated with proper manuscript content showing different pages
- High-resolution facsimile images successfully downloaded

### User Impact:
- Users can now download complete Morgan Library manuscripts instead of just the cover page
- All manuscript pages are properly extracted and available for download
- Fix ensures Morgan Library collection is fully accessible

## 2025-07-25: Library of Congress Timeout Fix & Wolfenbüttel Investigation

### Tasks Completed:
1. ✅ Investigated Wolfenbüttel download "cycle" issue for varia/selecta collections
2. ✅ Debugged and analyzed the perceived download loop problem
3. ✅ Tested Wolfenbüttel with multiple approaches and found no actual cycle
4. ✅ Created validation PDFs proving high-quality downloads work correctly
5. ✅ Fixed Library of Congress timeout issues for large manifests
6. ✅ Increased LOC timeout multiplier from 1.5 to 3.0 (45s → 90s)
7. ✅ Tested LOC fix with problematic manuscripts (2021667775, 2021667776, 19005901)
8. ✅ Validated all fixes pass lint and build checks

### Implementation Details:

**Wolfenbüttel Investigation:**
- No actual cycle or infinite loop exists in the code
- Pagination correctly processes all 347 pages for the test manuscript
- Downloads complete quickly (~1-2 minutes) with excellent speed (~2MB/s)
- Issue was likely inadequate progress reporting for large manuscripts
- Created validation PDF with 10 high-quality manuscript pages (2000px resolution)

**Library of Congress Fix:**
- Root cause: 45-second timeout too short for large manifests (up to 688KB)
- Solution: Increased timeout multiplier from 1.5x to 3.0x (30s base → 90s total)
- Affected manuscripts had 446, 194, and 121 pages respectively
- User experienced timeouts likely due to slower network conditions
- Fix allows sufficient time for downloading large manifests on various connections

### Validation Results:
- Wolfenbüttel: 10-page PDF created with high-resolution medieval manuscript images
- LOC: All three problematic manuscripts now load successfully in test environment
- Both libraries confirmed working with appropriate timeout handling

### Root Cause Analysis:
- **Florence Issue**: Accept-Encoding header was causing server to return compressed HTML (19KB) without __INITIAL_STATE__ data needed for compound object parsing. Fixed by removing problematic encoding header.
- **Most Other Issues**: Were network connectivity problems that resolved themselves or needed proper SSL bypass/timeout handling.
- **Library Search**: Was actually working correctly - issue was with test setup, not the component itself.

### Implementation Details:
- **Florence Fix**: Removed `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br` header that caused inconsistent server responses
- **SSL Bypasses**: Added for BNE Spain and Grenoble Municipal Library domains
- **Timeout Handling**: Extended timeouts for slow servers (MDC Catalonia, University of Graz)
- **Validation Protocol**: Created 7 comprehensive PDFs with distributed page sampling from different manuscript sections

### Final Validation Results:
- Library_of_Congress_FULL_validation.pdf (32.30 MB) - 10 pages ✅
