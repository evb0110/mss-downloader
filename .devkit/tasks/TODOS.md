# Project TODOs

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Library Search Bar Not Visible
**Task:** DEBUG: Investigate why library search bar is not visible in the UI
**Issue:** Code is implemented but user reports search bar is not showing up in the application
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High

**Investigation needed:**
- Check if development server needs restart
- Verify component is being rendered properly  
- Test search functionality works as expected
- Confirm no JavaScript errors are preventing render

### 2. Verify Search Bar Functionality
**Task:** FIX: Ensure library search bar is properly rendered and functional
**Issue:** Need to complete proper testing and verification of search implementation
**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** High

## Notes

- Library search implementation exists in code but needs verification
- Version 1.4.19 was released prematurely without proper testing
- Need to ensure all features work before marking as complete
- Development environment is clean and organized
- Belgica KBR remains documented as unsupported (requires complex implementation)
