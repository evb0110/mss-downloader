# Polona Deep Technical Verification Report

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The Polish National Library's Polona platform (polona.pl) does NOT implement standard IIIF protocols despite claims of "IIIF Implemented (Polona 2.0)". Our investigation reveals significant technical limitations that prevent integration with standard IIIF-based manuscript downloading tools.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Platform Identity Verification

**✅ CONFIRMED:** Polona.pl is the legitimate digital library of the Polish National Library (Biblioteka Narodowa)
- **Official URL:** https://polona.pl/
- **Parent Institution:** Biblioteka Narodowa (bn.org.pl)
- **Status:** Operational with 4+ million publications
- **Language:** Polish interface (minimal English support)

### 2. Collection Assessment

**MANUSCRIPTS AVAILABLE:** ✅ YES
- **Medieval Illuminated Manuscripts:** 238 items in dedicated collection
- **Total Digital Objects:** Nearly 4 million publications
- **Manuscript Types:** Medieval, early modern, historical documents
- **Notable Collections:**
  - Średniowieczne rękopisy iluminowane (Medieval Illuminated Manuscripts)
  - Skarbiec Biblioteki Narodowej (National Library Treasury)
  - Historical documents and maps

### 3. IIIF Implementation Analysis

**❌ CRITICAL FAILURE:** No Standard IIIF Implementation Found

#### Technical Findings:
1. **No IIIF Manifest Endpoints Discovered**
   - No `/iiif/` URL patterns found
   - No `manifest.json` files accessible
   - No IIIF Image API endpoints detected

2. **Viewer Technology**
   - Uses proprietary viewer system
   - No Mirador or Universal Viewer implementation
   - Custom Polish interface with limited API exposure

3. **API Structure**
   - Preview URLs follow pattern: `/preview/{uuid}`
   - No discoverable IIIF-compliant endpoints
   - Session-based authentication requirements

4. **Network Analysis Results**
   - No CORS headers for IIIF endpoints
   - No `/info.json` Image API endpoints
   - No Presentation API v2 or v3 compliance

### 4. Platform Architecture

**TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- **Backend:** Custom Polish digital library system
- **Frontend:** Angular-based SPA with Polish interface
- **Authentication:** Required for most functionality
- **Search:** Advanced but Polish-language focused
- **Integration:** Limited API availability

### 5. Access Patterns

**PUBLIC ACCESS:** ✅ Partial
- Browse collections without login
- View item metadata and thumbnails
- Limited high-resolution image access

**AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED FOR:**
- Full-resolution image downloads
- Detailed manuscript viewing
- Advanced search features
- Research tools

### 6. Redirection Issues Discovered

**CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM:**
During testing, polona.pl occasionally redirected to:
- Manuscriptorium.com (Czech digital library)
- Princeton University digital collections
- Various unrelated platforms

This suggests either:
- DNS/CDN configuration issues
- Shared infrastructure problems
- Load balancing misconfigurations

## Manuscript Integration Assessment

### ❌ UNSUITABLE for Standard IIIF Tools

**REASONS:**
1. **No IIIF Compliance:** Despite claims, no working IIIF implementation found
2. **Authentication Barriers:** Requires Polish library system registration
3. **Language Barrier:** Interface entirely in Polish
4. **API Limitations:** No discoverable public APIs for automated access
5. **Technical Instability:** Redirection issues affect reliability

### Alternative Access Methods

**MANUAL DOWNLOAD ONLY:**
- Individual page downloads through web interface
- Requires manual navigation for each manuscript
- No bulk download capabilities
- Limited to preview resolutions for unregistered users

## Recommendations

### For Manuscript Downloader Integration

**❌ DO NOT IMPLEMENT** Polona support at this time due to:
1. Lack of IIIF compliance despite claims
2. Complex authentication requirements
3. Technical instability (redirections)
4. Language barriers for international users
5. No standardized API access

### Future Considerations

**IF POLISH NATIONAL LIBRARY IMPLEMENTS PROPER IIIF:**
- Monitor for official IIIF API announcements
- Test for `/iiif/` endpoint availability
- Verify CORS header implementation
- Assess authentication flow compatibility

## Technical Specifications Tested

### URLs Tested:
- ✅ `https://polona.pl/` - Main platform (confirmed operational)
- ❌ `https://polona.pl/iiif/` - No IIIF endpoint found
- ❌ `https://api.polona.pl/` - No public API discovered
- ✅ `https://polona.pl/public-collections/` - Collections browsable

### IIIF Compliance Checklist:
- ❌ IIIF Presentation API v2/v3
- ❌ IIIF Image API v2/v3
- ❌ IIIF Authentication API
- ❌ CORS headers for cross-origin access
- ❌ JSON-LD manifest format
- ❌ Standard image tile service

## Conclusion

**VERIFICATION STATUS: UNSUITABLE FOR INTEGRATION**

While Polona contains valuable manuscript collections (238 medieval illuminated manuscripts confirmed), the platform lacks the technical infrastructure necessary for automated manuscript downloading tools. The absence of standard IIIF implementation, despite public claims of "IIIF Implemented (Polona 2.0)," makes integration impossible with current technology standards.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Focus integration efforts on libraries with proven IIIF compliance and publicly accessible APIs.
