- Open access with proper licensing

## Integration Strategy Assessment

### ‚ùå Direct IIIF Integration: NOT POSSIBLE
**Reason:** No IIIF implementation detected

### ‚úÖ Alternative Integration Approaches

#### 1. OAI-PMH Metadata Harvesting
**Feasibility:** HIGH (when server issues resolved)
```
Workflow:
1. Harvest manuscript metadata via OAI-PMH
2. Extract manuscript identifiers and descriptions
3. Cross-reference with digital collection URLs
4. Map to internal manuscript structure
```

#### 2. REST API Integration
**Feasibility:** MEDIUM (requires API documentation)
```
Approach:
1. Reverse engineer REST API endpoints
2. Identify manuscript listing and detail endpoints
3. Extract image URLs and metadata
4. Implement systematic download workflow
```

#### 3. Web Scraping with Systematic Discovery
**Feasibility:** HIGH (when server stable)
```
Strategy:
1. Navigate collection browse interface
2. Extract manuscript page URLs systematically
3. Parse manuscript viewer pages for image URLs
4. Download high-resolution images with proper attribution
```

#### 4. Collaborative Approach
**Feasibility:** HIGH
```
Recommendation:
1. Contact: digitalcollections@nlg.gr
2. Request: Technical documentation and partnership
3. Propose: Academic collaboration for manuscript digitization
4. Benefit: Mutual promotion of Greek heritage
```

## Resolution Quality Assessment

### Image Quality Analysis
- **Resolution:** High-resolution scans confirmed
- **Purpose:** Suitable for scholarly research and detailed examination
- **Format:** Likely JPEG or TIFF (format not specified in documentation)
- **Access:** Open access with attribution requirements

### Download Capabilities
- **Current Status:** No direct download mentioned in FAQ
- **Future Plans:** "Registered users will be able to download low-resolution copies"
- **Print Policy:** Explicitly not provided

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: Wait for Server Stability
**Action:** Monitor server status before attempting integration
**Timeline:** Ongoing monitoring required

### Priority 2: OAI-PMH Integration
**Steps:**
1. Test OAI-PMH endpoint when server stabilizes
2. Harvest complete manuscript metadata
3. Map metadata to collection structure
4. Identify manuscript viewing URLs

### Priority 3: Collaborative Partnership
**Approach:**
1. Formal outreach to National Library of Greece
2. Present academic/research use case
3. Request technical collaboration
4. Propose mutually beneficial partnership

### Priority 4: Alternative Technical Solutions
**If direct integration impossible:**
1. Systematic web crawling (respectful, rate-limited)
2. Manual manuscript identification and download
3. Community crowdsourcing approach
4. Academic institution partnership

## Current Limitations

### Technical Barriers
1. **Server Instability:** Disk space issues preventing access
2. **No IIIF:** Traditional viewing technology limits automation
3. **Limited API Documentation:** REST API not fully documented
4. **Access Restrictions:** Future download limitations planned

### Legal/Ethical Considerations
1. **Attribution Requirements:** Proper citation mandatory
2. **Copyright Compliance:** Respect Greek intellectual property law
3. **Rate Limiting:** Avoid overwhelming their servers
4. **Academic Use:** Focus on scholarly research applications

## Future Monitoring

### Technical Developments to Watch
1. **IIIF Implementation:** Monitor for future IIIF adoption
2. **API Documentation:** Watch for enhanced REST API docs
3. **Europeana Integration:** Check for future Europeana participation
4. **Server Improvements:** Monitor infrastructure upgrades

### Contact Information

## Conclusion

The National Library of Greece houses one of the world's most significant collections of Greek and Byzantine manuscripts (5,500+ items) with high-resolution digitization. However, **IIIF is not implemented**, requiring alternative integration strategies. 

**Best Path Forward:** OAI-PMH metadata harvesting combined with collaborative outreach offers the most promising approach for systematic manuscript access, pending resolution of current server infrastructure issues.

**Assessment Rating:** üìö **High Value, Medium Complexity**
- Exceptional manuscript collection quality and historical significance
- Technical integration possible but requires custom implementation
- Server stability issues need resolution before integration attempts
- Strong potential for academic collaboration and partnership
