## Issue #3 - Verona
Unfortunately, this appears to be a network/geo-blocking issue. As you mentioned, the site only opens through VPN ("—Å–∞–π—Ç –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –≤–ø–Ω"). 

This is not something that can be fixed in the application code. You'll need to use a VPN to access Verona manuscripts.

## Issue #2 - Graz
Tested successfully in version 1.4.62 - downloaded 644 pages without issues. If you're still experiencing problems, it may be specific to certain manuscripts or network conditions. Please try again with version 1.4.62 and let me know if the issue persists with specific URLs.
