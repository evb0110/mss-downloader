## Patterns Observed

### Downloads That Started But Had No PDF Output:
1. **LOC downloads** - Complete download sequence with multiple images (2-3MB each) successfully downloaded, but no PDF creation logged
2. **Vallicelliana** - Manifest loaded, images started downloading, but no PDF creation
3. **Most other libraries** - Only got to "Starting manifest load" phase

### Error Patterns:
1. **Verona** - Consistent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
2. **Graz** - Consistent timeout errors (90 seconds)
3. **Morgan** - 404 errors for direct image URLs

### Missing Final Steps:
The logs show successful:
- Manifest loading
- Image downloading (with file sizes)
- Buffer downloads

But completely missing:
- PDF creation messages
- Merge operations
- Final output notifications

## Conclusion

Users are attempting to download from multiple libraries, and while manifest loading and image downloading appear to work for some (especially LOC), the final PDF creation step is either:
1. Not happening at all
2. Not being logged properly
3. Failing silently without error messages

This suggests a critical issue in the PDF creation/merge phase of the application that needs investigation.
