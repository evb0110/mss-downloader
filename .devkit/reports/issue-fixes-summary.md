# GitHub Issues Fix Summary - Version 1.4.42

## Overview
Fixed 4 critical issues reported by users for various manuscript libraries.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. HHU DÃ¼sseldorf - Issue #1
**Problem**: `this.logger.logInfo is not a function` error when downloading manuscripts
**Root Cause**: Logger API mismatch - the logger service doesn't have a `logInfo` method
**Fix**: Changed all `this.logger.logInfo()` calls to `this.logger.log()` with proper parameters
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts` (6 occurrences fixed)

### 2. University of Graz - Issue #2  
**Problem**: Infinite manifest loading, manuscripts never complete downloading
**Root Cause**: SharedManifestAdapter was causing timeout issues with large Graz manuscripts
**Fix**: Force local implementation for Graz which has better timeout handling
**Code Change**:
```typescript
case 'graz':
    // FIXED: Always use local implementation which has better timeout handling
    manifest = await this.loadGrazManifest(originalUrl);
    break;
```

### 3. Verona NBM - Issue #3
**Problem**: ETIMEDOUT errors when connecting to 89.17.160.89:443
**Root Cause**: SharedManifestAdapter timeout issues with nuovabibliotecamanoscritta.it
**Fix**: Force local implementation for Verona to avoid timeout issues
**Code Change**:
```typescript
case 'verona':
    // FIXED: Use local implementation to avoid timeout issues with nuovabibliotecamanoscritta.it
    manifest = await this.loadVeronaManifest(originalUrl);
    break;
```

### 4. Morgan Library - Issue #4
**Problem**: Only finding 1 page instead of multiple pages from manuscripts
**Root Cause**: 
1. Page detection wasn't handling redirects from /thumbs to main collection page
2. Missing manuscript ID extraction for single page URLs
3. imagesByPriority variable scope issue

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Added redirect handling for 301/302 responses
2. Enhanced page URL detection with multiple patterns
3. Added fallback logic for single page URLs
4. Fixed variable scoping issues
