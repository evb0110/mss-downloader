# Library Fixes Comprehensive Test Report
**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Version:** 1.3.37  
**Issues Fixed:** BDL Servizi RL, Manuscripta.se, RBME library improvements

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. **BDL Servizi RL** - Manifest Timeout Issue
**Problem:** Finds manifest but doesn't proceed to download
**Root Cause:** Lack of proper timeout handling and validation in manifest loading
**Fix Applied:**
- Added 30-second timeout for manifest API requests
- Enhanced error handling with specific abort detection
- Added first image URL validation
- Improved logging for debugging

### 2. **Manuscripta.se** - Infinite Loop Issue  
**Problem:** Downloads complete but gets stuck in processing loop
**Root Cause:** Insufficient timeout monitoring during download processing
**Fix Applied:**
- Added 15-minute timeout monitoring for all downloads
- Enhanced progress tracking with specific Manuscripta.se logging
- Improved error handling and abort mechanisms
- Added timeout detection and recovery

### 3. **RBME** - File Splitting Display Issue
**Problem:** Shows as single file but creates multiple parts, UI doesn't reflect reality
**Root Cause:** Poor feedback during auto-splitting process
**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced auto-splitting logic with detailed progress reporting
- Added user-visible status updates during size checking and splitting
- Improved logging to show when documents are split and why
- Better notification when parts are created

## Test URLs

### Test Cases to Verify:
1. **BDL Servizi RL:** `https://www.bdl.servizirl.it/bdl/bookreader/index.html?path=fe&cdOggetto=3903`
2. **Manuscripta.se:** `https://manuscripta.se/ms/101105` 
3. **RBME:** `https://rbme.patrimonionacional.es/s/rbme/item/13238#?xywh=-852%2C-54%2C2433%2C1062`

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### BDL Servizi RL:
- ✅ Should load manifest within 30 seconds
- ✅ Should validate first image URL  
- ✅ Should proceed to download without hanging
- ✅ Clear error messages if timeout occurs

### Manuscripta.se:
- ✅ Should complete download within 15 minutes maximum
- ✅ Should transition to 'completed' status properly
- ✅ Should not get stuck in infinite processing loop
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

### RBME:
- ✅ Should show accurate progress during size checking
- ✅ Should notify user when document will be split
- ✅ Should create clearly named parts with page ranges
- ✅ Should update UI to reflect multiple parts being created

## Test Plan

1. **Start Application:** Launch in development mode
2. **Test Each URL:** Add each problematic URL to download queue
3. **Monitor Behavior:** Check for:
   - Proper timeout handling
   - Accurate progress reporting  
   - Successful completion or clear error messages
   - Proper file creation in download folder
4. **Verify Logs:** Check console output for enhanced debugging information

## Implementation Details

### Timeout Monitoring
- **Manifest Loading:** 30-second timeout for all library API calls
- **Download Processing:** 15-minute maximum timeout with automatic abort
- **Size Checking:** Clear progress indication during auto-split evaluation

### Enhanced Error Handling  
- Specific error messages for timeout scenarios
- Proper abort signal handling throughout the chain
- Type-safe error handling (fixed TypeScript issues)

### Improved User Feedback
- Progress status shows "Checking document size..." during evaluation
- Status shows "Splitting large document..." when auto-split occurs
- Console logs provide detailed information about splitting decisions
- Clear notification when parts are created with page ranges

## Development Notes
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ESLint passes without warnings
- PID-safe development commands used throughout
- Timeout constants configurable (15 minutes for downloads, 30 seconds for manifests)

**Next Steps:** 
1. Run comprehensive tests with all three URLs
2. Verify timeout behavior under simulated network conditions  
3. Test with various document sizes to verify auto-splitting
4. Update version and deploy if all tests pass
