1. **Critical User Impact (Always Translate)**
   - Download failures → "Fixed [Library] downloads"
   - Infinite loops → "Fixed infinite download loops"
   - Hanging/stalled → "Fixed hanging downloads"
   - Timeout errors → "Fixed loading timeouts"

2. **High User Impact (Simplify Technical Terms)**
   - Authentication issues → "Improved error handling"
   - Performance optimizations → "Enhanced performance"
   - Progress monitoring → "Improved progress tracking"
   - Quality improvements → "Enhanced image quality"

3. **Medium User Impact (Context-Dependent)**
   - New library support → "Added [Library] support"
   - Pagination fixes → "Fixed complete manuscript downloads"
   - URL format handling → Library-specific fix description
   - Metadata extraction → "Improved manuscript information"

4. **Low User Impact (Hide or Generalize)**
   - Technical refactoring → "System improvements"
   - Development tooling → Omit entirely
   - Code organization → Omit entirely
   - Internal optimizations → "Performance improvements"

### 3.2 Audience-Appropriate Language Levels

#### Casual Users (Default Audience)
- **Focus:** What changed in their experience
- **Language:** Simple, benefit-focused
- **Examples:**
  - "Fixed download failures" (not "resolved fetch timeout errors")
  - "Added new library support" (not "implemented IIIF manifest parsing")
  - "Improved reliability" (not "enhanced error handling with retry logic")

#### Researchers (Advanced Features)
- **Focus:** Accuracy and completeness of results
- **Language:** Domain-aware but non-technical
- **Examples:**
  - "Fixed complete manuscript downloads" (not "page range detection")
  - "Enhanced image quality" (not "resolution optimization algorithms")
  - "Improved metadata extraction" (not "IIIF manifest parsing")

#### Technical Users (Optional Detail)
- **Focus:** System behavior and reliability
- **Language:** Balanced technical and user terms
- **Examples:**
  - "Improved download reliability with timeout detection"
  - "Enhanced performance through direct connections"
  - "Fixed authentication error handling"

### 3.3 Context-Aware Translation Rules

#### Library-Specific Issues
```
Pattern: "Fix [Library] [technical issue]"
Rule: Always mention library name + user-visible problem
Examples:
- "Fix University of Graz timeout" → "Fixed University of Graz loading timeouts"
- "Fix Internet Culturale infinite loop" → "Fixed Internet Culturale infinite download loops"
- "Fix Manuscripta hanging downloads" → "Fixed Manuscripta.at hanging downloads"
```

#### Quality and Performance
```
Pattern: Technical optimization → User benefit
Rules:
- Speed improvements: "Enhanced performance"
- Reliability fixes: "Improved stability"
- Quality enhancements: "Enhanced image quality"
- Progress tracking: "Improved progress tracking"
```

#### New Features
```
Pattern: "Add/Implement [feature]" → "Added [user benefit]"
Rules:
- New library support: "Added [Library] support"
- New functionality: "Added [capability]"
- Enhanced features: "Enhanced [existing feature]"
```

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Current Telegram Bot Implementation Analysis

The current implementation in `telegram-bot/src/send-multiplatform-build.ts` uses hardcoded pattern matching:

```typescript
function extractUserFacingChangesFromVersionCommit(commitMessage: string): string[] {
  // Extract patterns like:
  if (part.match(/fix.*internet.*culturale.*infinite.*loop/i)) {
    changes.push('Fixed Internet Culturale infinite download loops');
  }
  // ... more hardcoded patterns
}
```

**Problems with Current Approach:**
- 300+ lines of hardcoded patterns
- Difficult to maintain
- Misses new technical terms
- No systematic mapping approach

### 4.2 Recommended Systematic Implementation

```typescript
interface TechnicalToUserMapping {
  technicalPatterns: RegExp[];
  userDescription: string;
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  audience: 'all' | 'researchers' | 'technical';
  category: 'infrastructure' | 'performance' | 'data' | 'quality';
}

const mappingRules: TechnicalToUserMapping[] = [
  // Critical Infrastructure Issues
  {
    technicalPatterns: [/timeout.*error/i, /loading.*timeout/i, /fetch.*timeout/i],
    userDescription: "Fixed loading timeouts",
    priority: 'critical',
    audience: 'all',
    category: 'infrastructure'
  },
  {
    technicalPatterns: [/infinite.*loop/i, /endless.*download/i, /stuck.*loop/i],
    userDescription: "Fixed infinite download loops", 
    priority: 'critical',
    audience: 'all',
    category: 'performance'
  },
  {
    technicalPatterns: [/hanging.*download/i, /stalled.*download/i, /stuck.*download/i],
    userDescription: "Fixed hanging downloads",
    priority: 'critical', 
    audience: 'all',
    category: 'performance'
  },
  
  // Library-Specific Patterns
  {
    technicalPatterns: [/authentication.*error/i, /preview.*non.*disponibile/i],
    userDescription: "Improved authentication error handling",
    priority: 'high',
    audience: 'all', 
    category: 'infrastructure'
  },
  
  // Performance Optimizations
  {
    technicalPatterns: [/improve.*performance/i, /enhance.*performance/i, /direct.*connection/i],
    userDescription: "Enhanced download performance",
    priority: 'high',
    audience: 'all',
    category: 'performance'
  },
  
  // Quality Improvements  
  {
    technicalPatterns: [/image.*quality/i, /resolution.*enhance/i, /high.*resolution/i],
    userDescription: "Enhanced image quality",
    priority: 'medium',
    audience: 'researchers',
    category: 'quality'
  }
];
```

### 4.3 Library-Specific Context Rules

```typescript
const libraryContextRules = {
  'internet_culturale': {
    'infinite loop': 'Fixed Internet Culturale infinite download loops',
    'authentication error': 'Fixed Internet Culturale authentication issues',
    'proxy usage': 'Enhanced Internet Culturale download performance'
  },
  'university_graz': {
    'timeout': 'Fixed University of Graz loading timeouts',
    'fetch failed': 'Fixed University of Graz download failures'
  },
  'manuscripta': {
    'hanging download': 'Fixed Manuscripta.at hanging downloads',
    'page range': 'Fixed Manuscripta page-specific downloads'
  },
  'europeana': {
    'pagination': 'Fixed Europeana complete manuscript downloads',
    'IIIF manifest': 'Fixed Europeana complete manuscript downloads'
  }
};
```

    expectedUser: [
      "Fixed Internet Culturale infinite download loops",
      "Improved authentication error handling", 
      "Enhanced download performance"
    ]
  },
  {
    technical: "VERSION-1.3.55: Fix University of Graz timeouts, add Rome BNC libroantico support, resolve Manuscripta.at hanging downloads",
    expectedUser: [
      "Fixed University of Graz loading timeouts",
      "Added Rome BNC libroantico collection support",
      "Fixed Manuscripta.at hanging downloads"
    ]
  }
];
```

### 6.2 User Language Quality Metrics

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Clarity:** Can average user understand the benefit?
- **Accuracy:** Does translation preserve the core improvement?
- **Brevity:** Is description concise but informative?
- **Consistency:** Do similar issues get similar descriptions?
