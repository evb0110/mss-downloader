# Download Failures Fixed - 2025-07-26

## Summary
Successfully fixed 3 critical download failures affecting Verona, Morgan Library, and University of Graz.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Verona Library - TypeError Fix
**Issue:** TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')
**Root Cause:** SharedManifestAdapter was returning wrong manifest structure
**Fix:** 
- Updated SharedManifestAdapter to return correct ManuscriptManifest structure
- Added displayName property to Verona manifest loader
**Files Modified:**
- `src/main/services/SharedManifestAdapter.ts` - Fixed manifest structure conversion
- `src/shared/SharedManifestLoaders.js` - Added displayName to Verona manifest

### 2. Morgan Library - 404 Errors
**Issue:** HTTP 404 errors due to `/thumbs` being appended to image URLs
**Root Cause:** Code was treating direct image URLs as manuscript page URLs
**Fix:**
- Added check to prevent appending `/thumbs` to image file URLs (.jpg, .png, etc.)
- Added special handling for direct image URLs in loadMorganManifest
**Files Modified:**
- `src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts` - Fixed URL handling logic

### 3. University of Graz - Timeouts
**Issue:** Connection timeouts after 90 seconds despite retry attempts
**Root Cause:** Server is very slow; SharedManifestLoaders had only 30s timeout
**Fix:**
- Increased timeout to 120 seconds for Graz URLs in SharedManifestLoaders
- Added displayName property to Graz manifest loader
**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/SharedManifestLoaders.js` - Increased timeout and added displayName
