- ✅ **User Tagging:** Tagged all authors (@textorhub) for v1.4.48 testing
- ✅ **Testing Instructions:** Clear instructions provided with restart reminders

## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS: MONITORING PHASE

### Active Monitoring Tasks
1. **User Response Tracking:** Checking `.devkit/tools/check-issue-responses.sh` for new feedback
2. **Issue Resolution Monitoring:** Tracking which issues get resolved vs. need further work
3. **Follow-up Actions:** Ready to implement additional fixes based on user reports

### Next Steps Based on User Responses
- **If users report success:** Close resolved issues after confirmation
- **If users report continued problems:** Analyze feedback and implement targeted fixes
- **If no response within 3 days:** Close issues with no-response explanation
