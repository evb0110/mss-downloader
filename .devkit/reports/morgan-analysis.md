# Morgan Library Analysis Report

## Issue Summary
User reports that Morgan Library still only finds one page despite fixes in v1.4.43. The problem persists with no changes.

## Root Cause Identified
The Morgan Library implementation in SharedManifestLoaders.js is working correctly and finds multiple pages. However, **the main application is NOT using the SharedManifestLoaders for Morgan Library**.

## Current State

### 1. SharedManifestLoaders Implementation (WORKING)
- Located in: `/src/shared/SharedManifestLoaders.js`
- Method: `getMorganManifest()` (lines 846-1061)
- Test result: Successfully finds 10 pages with unique URLs
- Supports multiple URL patterns and extracts high-resolution images

### 2. Main Application (USING OLD CODE)
- Located in: `/src/main/services/EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts`
- Still using old method: `loadMorganManifest()` (lines 1368-1754)
- This old implementation appears to have issues with page detection

### 3. Integration Issue
In `SharedManifestAdapter.ts` (line 57), the `isLibrarySupported()` method does NOT include 'morgan' in the supported libraries list:
```typescript
const supportedLibraries = ['bdl', 'verona', 'vienna_manuscripta', 'bne', 'mdc_catalonia', 'florence', 'grenoble', 'manchester', 'toronto', 'vatican', 'karlsruhe', 'loc', 'graz', 'bvpb'];
// Missing: 'morgan'
```

In `EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts` (line 1161), Morgan is handled by the old code:
```typescript
case 'morgan':
    manifest = await this.loadMorganManifest(originalUrl);  // OLD CODE
    break;
```

While other libraries like Florence use the shared adapter:
```typescript
case 'florence':
    manifest = await this.sharedManifestAdapter.getManifestForLibrary('florence', originalUrl);
    break;
```

## Fix Required

1. Add 'morgan' to the supported libraries list in `SharedManifestAdapter.ts`
2. Update the switch case in `EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts` to use the shared adapter
3. Optionally remove the old `loadMorganManifest()` method to avoid confusion

## Test Evidence

Running the SharedManifestLoaders directly with the user's URL:
```
URL: https://www.themorgan.org/collection/lindau-gospels/thumbs
Title: Lindau Gospels | (MS M.1)
Total pages found: 10
Unique URLs: 10 / 10
âœ“ Morgan Library implementation working correctly!
```

## Conclusion
The v1.4.43 fix was implemented in SharedManifestLoaders but the main application is still using the old, broken implementation. This explains why users see no change - the fix exists but isn't being used.
