# Verona Timeout Issue Analysis & Solution

## Current Implementation Issues

The current Verona implementation has several timeout-related problems:

1. **Fixed 120-second timeout**: Too aggressive for unstable connections
2. **Single timeout strategy**: Same timeout for manifest discovery vs manifest fetching
3. **Limited exponential backoff**: Only progressive delay, no exponential growth
4. **Connection pooling issues**: Agent reuse may cause connection instability
5. **No health checking**: No validation of server responsiveness before operations
6. **Limited error differentiation**: Generic timeout handling

## Root Cause Analysis

The Verona NBM server (`nuovabibliotecamanoscritta.it` and `nbm.regione.veneto.it`) appears to:
- Have intermittent connectivity issues
- Experience high load during certain periods
- Have DNS resolution delays
- Potentially throttle connections

## Enhanced Solution

### 1. Adaptive Timeout Strategy
- **Manifest Discovery**: 60 seconds (faster page fetching)
- **Manifest Fetching**: 180 seconds (larger JSON files)
- **Exponential backoff**: 2^retry * 3000ms base delay
- **Circuit breaker**: Temporary failure tracking

### 2. Connection Health Checking
- Pre-validate server responsiveness
- DNS resolution validation
- Basic connectivity test

### 3. Multiple Retry Strategies
- Network-level retries (DNS, connection)
- HTTP-level retries (timeouts, 5xx errors)
- Application-level retries (malformed responses)

### 4. Enhanced Error Messages
- Differentiate between network vs server issues
- Provide specific troubleshooting guidance
- Include estimated retry times

## Implementation Details

The solution involves:
1. Enhanced `fetchVeronaIIIFManifest` with adaptive timeouts
2. New health checking mechanism
3. Improved error handling and user feedback
4. Better connection management
5. Comprehensive logging for debugging
