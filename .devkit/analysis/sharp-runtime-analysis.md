# Sharp Runtime Analysis - Windows ARM64 ES Module Error

## Overview
The error occurs when the packaged Electron app runs on Windows ARM64 and attempts to load Sharp. The specific error:
```
Error: require() of ES module C:\Users\evb\AppData\Local\Temp\2ZgAKmJPBXWd6VFISNvibL1kQwE\resources\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\sharp\lib\sharp.js is not supported.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Sharp Loading Mechanism
1. **Sharp Package Structure**: Sharp uses `"type": "commonjs"` in its package.json
2. **Binary Loading**: Sharp dynamically loads native binaries via `require()` calls in `/lib/sharp.js`
3. **Platform Detection**: Sharp detects `win32-arm64` and tries to load `@img/sharp-win32-arm64/sharp.node`

### The Problem
The error path shows files being extracted to: `C:\Users\evb\AppData\Local\Temp\2ZgAKmJPBXWd6VFISNvibL1kQwE\resources\`

This suggests the Windows ARM64 build process is:
1. Extracting the entire app.asar.unpacked to a temporary directory
2. **CRITICAL**: Creating a `package.json` with `"type": "module"` in the temp directory
3. This makes Node.js interpret ALL `.js` files in that directory as ES modules
4. When Sharp tries to `require()` its CommonJS modules, Node.js throws the ES module error

### Why This Happens on Windows ARM64 Specifically
- Windows ARM64 builds may use different extraction/unpacking mechanisms
- The temp directory creation process is adding an incorrect `package.json` file
- Other platforms either don't extract to temp directories or don't create the problematic `package.json`

### Evidence from Code Analysis
- Sharp's `package.json` correctly specifies `"type": "commonjs"`
- Sharp's loading code in `/lib/sharp.js` uses standard `require()` calls
- No WebAssembly or dynamic extraction code found in Sharp itself
- The issue occurs during Electron's app extraction process, not Sharp's internal loading

## Key Findings

### 1. Sharp's Loading Process
```javascript
// From /lib/sharp.js
const paths = [
  `../src/build/Release/sharp-${runtimePlatform}.node`,
  '../src/build/Release/sharp-wasm32.node',
  `@img/sharp-${runtimePlatform}/sharp.node`,
  '@img/sharp-wasm32/sharp.node'
];

let path, sharp;
for (path of paths) {
  try {
    sharp = require(path); // This require() call fails
    break;
  } catch (err) {
    errors.push(err);
  }
}
```

### 2. Windows ARM64 Binary Structure
```
@img/sharp-win32-arm64/
├── package.json (type: "commonjs")
├── lib/
│   ├── libvips-42.dll
│   ├── libvips-cpp-8.16.1.dll
│   └── sharp-win32-arm64.node
└── versions.json
```

### 3. The Problematic Temp Directory
The error shows files in: `C:\Users\evb\AppData\Local\Temp\2ZgAKmJPBXWd6VFISNvibL1kQwE\resources\`

This temp directory contains:
- Extracted app.asar.unpacked contents
- **A `package.json` with `"type": "module"`** (not from Sharp!)
- This overrides Sharp's CommonJS configuration

## Solution Analysis

### NOT the Issue
- Sharp's package.json is correctly configured
- Sharp's loading code is standard CommonJS
- No WebAssembly or dynamic module loading in Sharp

### The Real Issue
The Windows ARM64 build process creates a temporary `package.json` file with `"type": "module"` in the extraction directory. This is likely:
1. **Electron Builder Issue**: The Windows ARM64 build process incorrectly creates an ES module `package.json`
2. **Runtime Extraction Issue**: The app unpacking process adds a `package.json` that shouldn't be there
3. **Build Configuration Issue**: Some build setting is causing ES module configuration to be applied

### Recommended Fix
The fix should target the build process, not Sharp itself:
1. **Investigate electron-builder configuration** for Windows ARM64
2. **Check for any ES module settings** in build process
3. **Ensure no `package.json` with `"type": "module"`** is created during extraction
4. **Verify Sharp's CommonJS configuration is preserved** in the final package

## Technical Details

### Sharp Package Analysis
- Main package: `"type": "commonjs"`
- Windows ARM64 binary: `@img/sharp-win32-arm64` also uses `"type": "commonjs"`
- All loading code uses standard `require()` calls
- No extraction or temp file creation in Sharp's code

### Error Path Analysis
The error occurs at runtime when:
1. Electron extracts app.asar.unpacked to temp directory
2. A `package.json` with `"type": "module"` is created in the temp directory
3. Node.js now treats all `.js` files in that directory as ES modules
4. Sharp's CommonJS `require()` calls fail

### Platform-Specific Behavior
- macOS/Linux: No temp directory extraction or different extraction mechanism
- Windows x64: May use different extraction process
- Windows ARM64: Uses problematic extraction that creates ES module `package.json`

## Conclusion

The issue is NOT with Sharp itself but with the Windows ARM64 build/extraction process creating a `package.json` with `"type": "module"` in the temporary directory. This overrides Sharp's correct CommonJS configuration and causes the ES module error.

The fix should focus on the build process to ensure no erroneous `package.json` files are created during extraction, and that Sharp's CommonJS configuration is preserved.
