## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

- morgan: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual morganLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- grenoble: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual grenobleLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- karlsruhe: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual karlsruheLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- manchester: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual manchesterLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- e_manuscripta: NO_IMPLEMENTATION: No loader or SharedManifest method found for e_manuscripta
- e_manuscripta: KEY_MISMATCH: detectLibrary returns "e_manuscripta" but routes to "emanuscripta"
- vatlib: NO_IMPLEMENTATION: No loader or SharedManifest method found for vatlib
- vatlib: KEY_MISMATCH: detectLibrary returns "vatlib" but routes to "vatican"
- bl: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual blLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- gams: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual gamsLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- vienna_manuscripta: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual vienna_manuscriptaLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- rome: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual romeLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- omnes_vallicelliana: MISSING_ROUTING: No routing case found in switch statement for omnes_vallicelliana
- verona: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual veronaLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features
- bvpb: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual bvpbLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features

- onb: TWO_IMPLEMENTATIONS_BUG: Has individual onbLoader but routes to SharedManifest - should use individual loader for better features

## Priority Recommendations

1. PRIORITY 1: Fix 12 Two Implementations Bugs - Route to individual loaders instead of SharedManifest for better performance
2. PRIORITY 2: Fix 2 routing key mismatches - Align detectLibrary() output with switch case routing
3. PRIORITY 3: Update 8 fragile URL patterns to be more robust to future changes
4. PRIORITY 4: Update URL patterns for 2 libraries with breaking URL format changes

## Library Evolution Analysis

### High-Priority Libraries with URL Changes

**gallica:**
  - ARK identifier format evolution
  - IIIF manifest URL structure updates
  - **Fix:** Update ARK identifier parsing logic

**e_manuscripta:**
  - Platform migration affecting URL structure
  - IIIF manifest URL changes
  - **Fix:** Update e-manuscripta.ch URL parsing


## Future-Proofing Strategies

- Use domain-based detection over path-based detection when possible
- Implement multiple pattern matching per library for redundancy
- Create flexible pattern matching with regex instead of simple string matching
- Add automated URL pattern validation testing to CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor library websites for URL structure changes
- Implement graceful fallback detection for pattern mismatches
- Create library-agnostic IIIF manifest detection for standards-compliant libraries
- Add pattern versioning to handle gradual migration periods
