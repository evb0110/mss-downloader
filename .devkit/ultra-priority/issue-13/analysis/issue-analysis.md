=== ðŸ”¥ ULTRA-PRIORITY ISSUE ANALYSIS ðŸ”¥ ===
Target Issue: #13 - Biblioteca Municipal de Grenoble
Author: @evb0110
Created: Unknown (but fixed 5 times already\!)

COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE BREAKDOWN:
1. Primary Error: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN pagella.bm-grenoble.frhttps://pagella.bm-grenoble.fr/...
2. Affected URL: https://pagella.bm-grenoble.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10663927k/f1.item.zoom
3. Library System: Grenoble Municipal Library (French IIIF implementation)
4. Root Cause Hypothesis: URL concatenation bug - hostname being prepended to full URL
5. Related Components: SharedManifestLoaders.js - URL parsing/construction logic
6. Historical Context: 5 previous "fixes" that didn't solve the actual problem

DUPLICATE FIX HISTORY:
- This issue has been "fixed" 5 times in recent commits
- Each fix claimed to solve it but the problem persists
- This indicates the root cause was never properly identified

RESOURCE ALLOCATION:
- Analysis Depth: MAXIMUM
- Test Coverage: EXHAUSTIVE
- Validation Cycles: UNLIMITED
- Time Investment: AS NEEDED

CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
The error shows "pagella.bm-grenoble.frhttps://..." which is clearly:
- Hostname: pagella.bm-grenoble.fr
- Being concatenated with full URL: https://pagella.bm-grenoble.fr/...
- This creates an invalid hostname for DNS resolution

NEXT STEPS:
1. Find exact code location causing URL concatenation
2. Understand why 5 previous fixes failed
3. Implement proper URL handling
4. Test exhaustively with Grenoble URLs
