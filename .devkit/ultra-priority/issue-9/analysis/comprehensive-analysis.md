Target Issue: #9 - BDL (Biblioteca Digitale Lombarda)
Author: @textorhub
Created: 2025-07-31

COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE BREAKDOWN:
1. Primary Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND www.bdl.servizirl.ithttps://www.bdl.servizirl.it/vufind/Record/BDL-OGGETTO-3903
   - URL appears malformed: "www.bdl.servizirl.ithttps://" (concatenated)
   
2. Current Problem (2025-08-08): "–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—É—Å—Ç—ã—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü –ø—Ä–∏ —Å–∫–∞—á–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏" (many empty pages when downloading)
   - This suggests the URL parsing might be fixed but pages are downloaded as empty

3. Affected URL: https://www.bdl.servizirl.it/vufind/Record/BDL-OGGETTO-3903

4. Library System: BDL (Biblioteca Digitale Lombarda) - Italian library

5. Root Cause Hypothesis: 
   - Initial: URL concatenation error causing DNS lookup failure
   - Current: Pages downloading but appearing empty (possible image path issues)

6. Related Components:
   - SharedManifestLoaders.js - URL parsing and manifest loading
   - EnhancedManuscriptDownloaderService.ts - download queue processing
   - ElectronPdfMerger.ts - PDF generation from images

7. Historical Context:
   - Issue #9 was "fixed" in v1.4.116 and v1.4.121
   - User still reports empty pages, suggesting incomplete fix

RESOURCE ALLOCATION:
- Analysis Depth: MAXIMUM
- Test Coverage: EXHAUSTIVE
- Validation Cycles: UNLIMITED
- Time Investment: AS NEEDED
