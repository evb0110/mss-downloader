ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDERS BEFORE COMMIT ðŸš¨

Before committing fixes for user-reported issues, verify:

âœ“ Used PRODUCTION CODE for testing (not isolated scripts)
âœ“ Tested EXACT USER URLs (not 'better' alternatives)  
âœ“ REPRODUCED user errors before fixing
âœ“ Fixed ROOT CAUSES (not symptoms)
âœ“ VALIDATED with same URLs that were failing

Remember v1.4.49: We claimed fixes but delivered ZERO.

Press Enter to continue if ALL above are verified..."
