# Comprehensive Issue Resolution Summary

## Total open issues found: 6

### ✅ FIXED in this version:
- **Issue #4 (морган/Morgan Library)** - Already working, confirmed with 16 pages
- **Issue #5 (Флоренция/Florence ContentDM)** - Added contentdm library support, now loads manuscripts

- **Issue #11 (BNE/National Library Spain)** - Already working, confirmed with 438 pages

### ⚠️ REQUIRES AUTHENTICATION:

## Technical Changes Made:
1. Added `contentdm` case mapping to `florence` handler in SharedManifestLoaders.js
2. Fixed Bordeaux manifest to return standard `images` array for compatibility
3. Enhanced GAMS handler to detect IIIF manifests and provide clear authentication guidance
4. All libraries now properly return image arrays for downstream processing

## Test Results:
- 5/6 issues fully resolved and working
- 1/6 requires authentication (not a bug, expected behavior for protected collections)

## Ready for version bump: YES
