# TODOs

## Pending Tasks

- Add support for Stanford Parker Library: https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/ - Support URLs like https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/zs345bj2650 (22 URLs provided, similar format)

## Completed Tasks

- Fix Orl√©ans timeout error: Enhanced timeout handling for Orleans manuscript downloads by increasing timeouts from 15s to 30s, added multiple fallback search strategies (original query, first two words, first word, lowercase variants, partial matches), and added specific handling for "OUVRAGESDEPSEUDOISIDORE--PSEUDOISIDORE" URLs to correctly map to "Ouvrages de Pseudo Isidore" search query. Fixed URL processing to handle complex Orleans manuscript titles properly.

- Fix manifest loading UI issues: Fixed page counter showing incorrect "1 of 0" during manifest loading by showing "Loading manifest..." instead. Fixed Start Queue button showing wrong text like "Resume" when disabled during manifest loading. Enhanced loading state logic to properly handle manifest loading status indicators and button text.

- Fix MIRA/Trinity Dublin access error: Enhanced error handling to distinguish between accessible MIRA items (like /105 pointing to ISOS/RIA) vs blocked ones (like /98, /107 pointing to Trinity Dublin with reCAPTCHA protection). Added detailed error messages identifying the institution and manifest URL causing issues.

- Implement possibility to change order of items either with arrows or with dragging. Only whole items should be moved, not parts. So we should redesign the relation item <-> parts. E.g. now it's extremely bad, that we cannot delete all parts of one item in one go. Button Edit should only belong to the whole item, button delete should belong to both item and part.

- Fix folder creation with special symbols that cannot be opened by some users for this Unicatt link: https://digitallibrary.unicatt.it/veneranda/0b02da8280051c10
