# TODOs

## Pending Tasks

- user enters `/unsubscribe` and nothing happens. Same with other actions. Sometimes they randomly receive buttons from the bot long after, but these buttons don't work. This todo is top priority, there were attempts from the agent to fix it many times, with no success. Use all your resources and skills

## Usage

When user says "todo: [task]" → Add to "Pending Tasks" section
When user says "handle todos" → Process first pending task, then move to TODOS-COMPLETED.md when complete

<!-- All completed tasks moved to TODOS-COMPLETED.md -->
