# Setting Bot Profile Picture - Manual Instructions

## Why this needs to be done manually
Telegram Bot API doesn't allow bots to set their own profile pictures programmatically for security reasons. This must be done through @BotFather.

## Steps to set the bot profile picture:

1. **Start a chat with @BotFather** on Telegram
2. **Send the command:** `/mybots`
3. **Select your bot:** `@abbaababusbot` 
4. **Click "Edit Bot"**
5. **Click "Edit Botpic"**
6. **Send the profile image**
