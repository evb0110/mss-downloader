List all pending todos from the project's TODOS.md file.

**Process:**
1. Check if TODOS.md exists in current project
2. Read and display all pending tasks (those WITHOUT âœ… checkmark)
3. Show task priorities and organization
4. Provide overview of what needs to be done

**File Structure:**
- **TODOS.md**: Contains only pending tasks and usage instructions
- **TODOS-COMPLETED.md**: Archive of completed tasks organized by version

If TODOS.md doesn't exist, I'll inform you that the project doesn't have a todo system set up yet and offer to create the initial structure.
